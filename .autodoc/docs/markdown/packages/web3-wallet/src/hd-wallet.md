This file contains functions and classes related to HD wallets and private key derivation. The code is part of the Oxygenium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The file imports several modules from the `@oxygenium/web3` package, which provides a JavaScript library for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain. It also imports the `bip39` and `bip32` modules, which are used for mnemonic phrase generation and hierarchical deterministic (HD) key derivation, respectively.

The file exports several functions for deriving private keys from a mnemonic phrase, including `deriveHDWalletPrivateKey`, `deriveSecp256K1PrivateKey`, and `deriveSchnorrPrivateKey`. These functions take a mnemonic phrase, a key type (either 'default' or 'bip340-schnorr'), an optional address index, and an optional passphrase. They return a private key in hexadecimal format.

The file also exports several functions for deriving private keys for a specific group, including `deriveHDWalletPrivateKeyForGroup`, `deriveSecp256K1PrivateKeyForGroup`, and `deriveSchnorrPrivateKeyForGroup`. These functions take a mnemonic phrase, a target group number, a key type, an optional address index, and an optional passphrase. They return a tuple containing a private key in hexadecimal format and the address index used to derive the key.

The file exports several utility functions for constructing HD wallet paths, including `getHDWalletPath`, `getSecp259K1Path`, and `getSchnorrPath`. These functions take an address index and return an HD wallet path string.

Finally, the file exports a `HDWallet` class, which provides an in-memory HD wallet implementation. The class extends the `SignerProviderWithCachedAccounts` class from the `@oxygenium/web3` package and provides methods for deriving and adding new accounts, as well as signing raw transactions. The `HDWallet` constructor takes a mnemonic phrase, a key type, a node provider, an explorer provider, and an optional passphrase. The class uses the `deriveHDWalletPrivateKey` and `deriveHDWalletPrivateKeyForGroup` functions to derive private keys and construct accounts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains functions and classes related to HD wallets and private key derivation for the Oxygenium blockchain.

2. What is the license for this code?
- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.

3. What is the difference between `HDWallet` and the other `derive...` functions?
- `HDWallet` is a class that provides an in-memory HD wallet implementation for simple use cases, while the `derive...` functions are used to derive private keys for specific purposes (e.g. `deriveSecp256K1PrivateKey` for secp256k1 keys).
