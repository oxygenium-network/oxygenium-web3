This file contains a set of functions that are used to interact with Alephium wallets. The functions are designed to help users interact with different wallet providers and retrieve wallet objects. 

The `getDefaultAlephiumWallet()` function is used to retrieve the default Alephium wallet. It returns a promise that resolves to an `AlephiumWindowObject` or `undefined`. 

The `scanKnownWallets()` function is used to scan all known wallet providers and retrieve their wallet objects. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of `AlephiumWindowObject`s. 

The `getKnownWallet()` function is used to retrieve the wallet object for a specific wallet provider. It takes a `WalletProvider` object as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to an `AlephiumWindowObject` or `undefined`. 

The `getWalletObject()` function is used to retrieve the wallet object for a specific wallet provider ID. It takes a string ID as an argument and returns an `AlephiumWindowObject` or `undefined`. 

The `isWalletObj()` function is used to check if a given object is a valid wallet object. It takes an object as an argument and returns a boolean value. 

Overall, these functions are used to help users interact with different wallet providers and retrieve wallet objects. They are an important part of the Alephium project and are used extensively throughout the codebase.
