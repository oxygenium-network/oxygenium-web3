[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/oxygenium/oxygenium-web3/packages/get-extension-wallet/src/knownProviders.ts)

This code defines a wallet provider for the Oxygenium blockchain and exports it for use in the larger project. The `oxygeniumProvider` object contains metadata about the provider, including an ID, name, icon, and download links for the Chrome and Firefox extensions. This object is then added to the `knownProviders` array, which is used to keep track of all available wallet providers.

The `checkProviderMetadata` function takes in a `wallet` object and a `provider` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the `wallet` object matches the `provider` object based on their ID and name. This function is used to verify that the user's selected wallet provider is valid and supported by the Oxygenium-web3 library.

Overall, this code provides a standardized way for users to connect their wallets to the Oxygenium blockchain and ensures that only supported wallet providers are used. It can be used in conjunction with other modules in the Oxygenium-web3 project to enable wallet functionality for dApps and other blockchain applications. 

Example usage:

```
import { oxygeniumProvider, knownProviders, checkProviderMetadata } from 'oxygenium-web3'

// Check if a wallet matches the Oxygenium provider
const wallet = { id: 'oxygenium', name: 'Oxygenium', version: '1.0.0' }
const isOxygeniumProvider = checkProviderMetadata(wallet, oxygeniumProvider) // true

// Get all known wallet providers
const providers = knownProviders // [oxygeniumProvider]
```
