This file contains various interfaces, functions, and classes that are used in the Oxygenium project. The code imports several modules from the `@oxygenium/web3` package, which provides a set of tools for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain. 

The `Network` interface defines the properties of a network, including the network ID, node URL, private keys, deployment status file, and confirmations. The `Configuration` interface defines the configuration options for the Oxygenium project, including the node version, node configuration file, source directory, artifact directory, deployment script directory, and compiler options. 

The `DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION_VALUES` object defines the default configuration values for the Oxygenium project, including the default network ID, network settings, and compiler options. 

The `Environment` interface defines the environment for the Oxygenium project, including the configuration, network, and node provider. The `getEnv` function returns an environment object based on the specified configuration file name and network ID. 

The `ExecutionResult` interface defines the result of executing a script or contract, including the transaction ID, unsigned transaction, signature, gas amount, gas price, block hash, and code hash. The `DeployContractExecutionResult` interface extends the `ExecutionResult` interface and adds the contract instance and issue token amount properties. The `RunScriptResult` interface extends the `ExecutionResult` interface and adds the group index property. 

The `Deployer` interface defines the properties and methods of a deployer, including the provider, account, `deployContract` method, `runScript` method, `getDeployContractResult` method, and `getRunScriptResult` method. The `DeployFunction` interface defines a deploy function that takes a deployer and network as arguments and returns a promise that resolves to `void` or `boolean`. 

Overall, this file provides the necessary interfaces, functions, and classes for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain and deploying contracts and scripts. It is an essential part of the Oxygenium project and is used extensively throughout the project.
