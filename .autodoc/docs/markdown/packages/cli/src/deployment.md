The code in this file is part of the deployment process for Oxygenium smart contracts and scripts. It provides functionality to deploy contracts and execute scripts on the Oxygenium blockchain, as well as manage deployment results and configurations.

The `Deployments` class manages deployment results for multiple addresses. It can load deployment results from a file, save them back to a file, and retrieve deployment results for a specific address or group. The `DeploymentsPerAddress` class represents deployment results for a single address, including deployed contracts, executed scripts, and migrations.

The `createDeployer` function creates a `Deployer` object, which provides methods to deploy contracts, run scripts, and retrieve deployment results. It takes a network configuration, a signer (private key wallet), and maps for deployment results as input. The `deployContract` and `runScript` methods in the `Deployer` object handle the deployment of contracts and execution of scripts, respectively. They also manage the deployment results, updating them if necessary.

The `deploy` function is the main entry point for deploying contracts and executing scripts. It takes a configuration object, a network ID, and a `Deployments` object as input. It first validates the provided configuration, compiles the project, and then iterates through the deployment scripts, executing them using the `Deployer` object. The deployment results are updated accordingly.

The `deployToDevnet` function is a convenience function for deploying to the Oxygenium devnet. It loads the configuration, creates an empty `Deployments` object, and calls the `deploy` function with the devnet network ID.

In summary, this code provides a comprehensive deployment process for Oxygenium smart contracts and scripts, managing deployment results and configurations, and allowing users to deploy and execute their code on the Oxygenium blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `oxygenium-web3` project?
   **Answer**: The `oxygenium-web3` project is a library that provides functionalities for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain, such as deploying and executing smart contracts, managing accounts, and handling transactions.

2. **Question**: How does the `Deployments` class handle saving and loading deployment information?
   **Answer**: The `Deployments` class provides methods like `saveToFile`, `from`, and `load` to handle saving and loading deployment information. It saves the deployment information to a JSON file and reads from it when loading the data.

3. **Question**: How does the `deploy` function work and what are its main components?
   **Answer**: The `deploy` function is responsible for deploying smart contracts and executing scripts on the Oxygenium blockchain. It takes a configuration object, a network ID, and a `Deployments` instance as input. The function first validates the network configuration, compiles the project, and then iterates through the deployment scripts, executing each script using the `Deployer` instance created for each signer.
