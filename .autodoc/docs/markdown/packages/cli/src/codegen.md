This code is responsible for generating TypeScript code for the Oxygenium blockchain project. It focuses on creating code for contracts, scripts, and deployment files. The generated code allows developers to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain using TypeScript, making it easier to build and test applications.

The main functions in this code are:

- `genContract`: Generates TypeScript code for a given contract, including methods for calling contract functions, fetching contract state, and subscribing to contract events.
- `genScript`: Generates TypeScript code for a given script, including a method to execute the script on the blockchain.
- `genContracts`, `genScripts`, and `genIndexTs`: These functions generate TypeScript files for all contracts and scripts in the project, as well as an index file that exports all generated code.
- `genDeploymentsType` and `genLoadDeployments`: These functions generate TypeScript code for loading deployment information for contracts and scripts, based on the network they are deployed on.

Here's an example of how the generated code might be used in a larger project:

```typescript
import { MyContract, MyScript } from '@oxygenium/web3';

// Deploy a contract
const contractInstance = await MyContract.deploy(params);

// Call a contract method
const result = await contractInstance.methods.myMethod(params);

// Execute a script
const scriptResult = await MyScript.execute(params);
```

Overall, this code generation module simplifies the process of interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain by providing a TypeScript interface for contracts and scripts.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `toTsType` function?**

   The `toTsType` function is used to convert a given `ralphType` (a custom type used in the Oxygenium project) to its corresponding TypeScript type. It handles basic types like 'U256', 'I256', 'Bool', 'Address', and 'ByteVec', as well as array types.

2. **How does the `genContract` function work?**

   The `genContract` function generates TypeScript code for a given contract. It takes a `Contract` object and an `artifactRelativePath` as input, and returns a string containing the generated TypeScript code. The generated code includes type definitions, class definitions, and methods for interacting with the contract on the blockchain.

3. **What is the purpose of the `genLoadDeployments` function?**

   The `genLoadDeployments` function generates TypeScript code for loading deployment information of contracts for different network IDs. It takes a `Configuration` object as input and generates a TypeScript file named `deployments.ts` in the specified output directory. The generated code includes functions for loading deployment information based on the network ID and deployer address, as well as type definitions for deployment results.
