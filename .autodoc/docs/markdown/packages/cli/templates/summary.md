The `.autodoc/docs/json/packages/cli/templates` folder contains templates for the `oxygenium-web3` project, which is a JavaScript library for interacting with the Alephium blockchain. The templates provide a starting point for developers to build applications that interact with the Alephium blockchain using the `@oxygenium/web3` library.

The `base` subfolder contains the `oxygenium.config.ts` file, which serves as a central configuration file for network and settings information. It defines a `Settings` type and a `defaultSettings` object, as well as network configurations for `devnet`, `testnet`, and `mainnet`. The `scripts` folder contains the `0_deploy_faucet.ts` script for deploying the `TokenFaucet` contract, while the `src` folder contains the `token.ts` file, demonstrating how to interact with a smart contract using the `@oxygenium/web3` library.

```typescript
import configuration, { Settings } from './configuration'

const devnetSettings: Settings = configuration.networks.devnet.settings
const nodeUrl: string = configuration.networks.devnet.nodeUrl
const privateKeys: string[] = configuration.networks.devnet.privateKeys
```

The `react` subfolder contains the `config-overrides.js` file, which customizes the webpack configuration for building and running the project in a browser environment. The `src` folder contains the `App.tsx` file, which serves as the entry point for a React application that interacts with the Alephium blockchain.

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack')
const overrideConfig = require('./overrideConfig')

const config = {
  // default webpack configuration
}

const newConfig = overrideConfig(config)

webpack(newConfig, (err, stats) => {
  // handle webpack build results
})
```

The `shared` subfolder contains the `tsconfig.json` file, which is a crucial configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It contains various settings that dictate how the TypeScript code should be compiled and ensures that the code is compiled correctly with the desired settings.

```typescript
interface Example {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const example: Example = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Alephium",
};

console.log(example);
```

In summary, the code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/packages/cli/templates` folder provides a foundation for building applications that interact with the Alephium blockchain using the `@oxygenium/web3` library. Developers can extend this code to create more complex applications that leverage the power of the Alephium blockchain and its smart contracts.
