The code is a script that demonstrates how to use the `@oxygenium/web3` library to interact with a smart contract deployed on the Oxygenium blockchain. Specifically, the script withdraws tokens from a `TokenFaucet` contract and prints the latest state of the contract.

The script first imports necessary libraries such as `Deployments` from `@oxygenium/cli`, `web3`, `Project`, and `DUST_AMOUNT` from `@oxygenium/web3`, and `testNodeWallet` from `@oxygenium/web3-test`. It also imports `configuration` from `../oxygenium.config` and `TokenFaucet` and `Withdraw` from `../artifacts/ts`.

The `withdraw()` function is an asynchronous function that performs the following steps:

1. Sets the current node provider to `http://127.0.0.1:22973`.
2. Builds the contracts of the project if they are not compiled.
3. Retrieves a test wallet for demonstration purposes.
4. Loads the deployments from the configuration file for the `devnet` network.
5. Iterates through each account in the test wallet and performs the following steps:
   1. Sets the active account to prepare and sign transactions.
   2. Retrieves the metadata of the deployed `TokenFaucet` contract in the account's group.
   3. If the contract is not deployed in the group, the script logs a message and continues to the next account.
   4. Otherwise, the script retrieves the contract ID and address.
   5. Submits a transaction to withdraw tokens from the `TokenFaucet` contract using the `Withdraw` transaction script.
   6. Retrieves the latest state of the `TokenFaucet` contract using the `TokenFaucet` contract instance.
   7. Prints the state of the contract.

Finally, the `withdraw()` function is called to execute the script.

This code can be used as a reference for developers who want to interact with smart contracts on the Oxygenium blockchain using the `@oxygenium/web3` library. Developers can modify the code to interact with other contracts and networks by changing the configuration file and the contract names.
