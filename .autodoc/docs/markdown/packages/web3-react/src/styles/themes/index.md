This code exports an object containing various themes for a web3 interface library called Oxygenium. The themes are defined in separate files and imported into this file using ES6 module syntax. The exported object contains properties for each theme, with the property name being the name of the theme and the value being an object containing the theme's styles.

This code is important for the larger project because it allows users of the Oxygenium web3 interface library to easily switch between different visual themes for the interface. By importing the desired theme from this file and passing it to the appropriate component in the library, users can customize the look and feel of the interface to their liking.

For example, if a user wants to use the "web95" theme, they can import it from this file like so:

```
import { web95 } from 'oxygenium-web3/themes'
```

And then pass it to the appropriate component in the library like so:

```
<SomeComponent theme={web95} />
```

This will apply the "web95" theme styles to the component, giving it a distinct visual appearance.

Overall, this code is a simple but important part of the Oxygenium web3 interface library, allowing users to customize the look and feel of the interface to their liking.
