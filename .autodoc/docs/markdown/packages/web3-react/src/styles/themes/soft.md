This code exports a JavaScript object that contains a set of CSS variables. These variables define the styling for various UI elements in the Oxygenium web3 project. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for defining the styling of UI elements in the project. By using CSS variables, the styling can be easily modified and updated across the entire project. 

For example, the `--ck-connectbutton-background` variable defines the background color for the connect button element. This variable can be referenced in the CSS for the connect button element like this:

```
.connect-button {
  background-color: var(--ck-connectbutton-background);
}
```

If the background color for the connect button needs to be changed, it can be updated in this file and the change will be reflected across the entire project.

Overall, this code is an important part of the Oxygenium web3 project as it allows for consistent and easily maintainable styling across the entire project.
