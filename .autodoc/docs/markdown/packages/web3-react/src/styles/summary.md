The code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/packages/web3-react/src/styles` folder is responsible for defining and managing the visual styles of the Oxygenium Web3 project. It provides a centralized and flexible way to create and customize themes for different parts of the application, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes based on their preferences.

For example, the `defaultTheme.ts` file defines the default theme for the project, which can be used throughout the project to provide a consistent appearance for UI elements. The `userPrefersDarkMode` function can be used to determine whether to use a dark or light theme by default, depending on the user's device settings.

```javascript
import { defaultTheme, userPrefersDarkMode } from 'oxygenium-web3/styles';

const theme = userPrefersDarkMode() ? defaultTheme.dark : defaultTheme.light;
```

The `index.ts` file in the `styles` folder defines theme variables for a modal component used in the Oxygenium project. Developers can use the pre-defined color schemes or define their own custom themes by passing in values for the `$customTheme` prop.

```javascript
import { themes } from 'oxygenium-web3/styles';

const customTheme = {
  ...themes.light,
  primary: {
    color: 'rgb(255, 0, 0)',
  },
};

<ModalComponent $customTheme={customTheme} />;
```

The `types.ts` file defines types and interfaces related to theming and styling for the Oxygenium project. Developers can use these types and interfaces to create and customize themes for different parts of the application.

```typescript
import { Theme, ThemeMode } from 'oxygenium-web3/styles/types';

const lightTheme: Theme = {
  // ...
};

const darkTheme: Theme = {
  // ...
};

const themeMode: ThemeMode = {
  preferred: 'light',
  light: lightTheme,
  dark: darkTheme,
};
```

The `styled` folder exports a styled component from the `styled-components` library, which allows developers to create custom styled components using a CSS-in-JS approach.

```jsx
import styled from 'oxygenium-web3/styles/styled';

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
`;

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `themes` folder contains a collection of theme files that define the styling for various UI components in the Oxygenium Web3 project. These theme files export JavaScript objects containing CSS variables, which are used to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.

```javascript
import { web95 } from 'oxygenium-web3/styles/themes';

<SomeComponent theme={web95} />;
```

In summary, the code in the `styles` folder plays a crucial role in defining the visual style of the Oxygenium Web3 project and ensuring that it is consistent across different components. By using the CSS variables and functions defined in these files, developers can create a consistent and visually appealing UI for their users.
