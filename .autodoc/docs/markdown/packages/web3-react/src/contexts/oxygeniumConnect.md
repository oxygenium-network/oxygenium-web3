This file defines a React context and a custom hook for the Oxygenium Connect feature of the Oxygenium project. The Oxygenium Connect feature allows users to connect their wallets to the Oxygenium network and perform transactions.

The `OxygeniumConnectContext` is a context object that holds the state of the Oxygenium Connect feature. It contains properties such as `open`, `route`, `errorMessage`, `connectorId`, `account`, `signerProvider`, `addressGroup`, `keyType`, `network`, `theme`, `mode`, and `customTheme`. These properties are used to manage the state of the Oxygenium Connect feature and to provide access to the current state of the feature to other components in the application.

The `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook is used to access the `OxygeniumConnectContext` object from within a component. It throws an error if the hook is not used within a `Provider` component.

This file also imports several types and classes from the `@oxygenium/web3` and `../types` modules. These modules contain type definitions and classes that are used to interact with the Oxygenium network and to define the types of the properties in the `OxygeniumConnectContext` object.

Overall, this file provides the context and hook necessary to manage the state of the Oxygenium Connect feature in a React application. It can be used to connect a user's wallet to the Oxygenium network and to perform transactions on the network. Here is an example of how the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook can be used in a component:

```
import { useOxygeniumConnectContext } from './path/to/OxygeniumConnectContext'

function MyComponent() {
  const { account, setAccount } = useOxygeniumConnectContext()

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    // Connect to wallet and set account
    const account = await connectToWallet()
    setAccount(account)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {account ? (
        <p>Connected to {account.address}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect to Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```
