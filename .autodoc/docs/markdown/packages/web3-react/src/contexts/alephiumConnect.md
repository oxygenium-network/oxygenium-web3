This file defines a React context and a custom hook for the Alephium Connect feature of the Alephium project. The Alephium Connect feature allows users to connect their wallets to the Alephium network and perform transactions.

The `AlephiumConnectContext` is a context object that holds the state of the Alephium Connect feature. It contains properties such as `open`, `route`, `errorMessage`, `connectorId`, `account`, `signerProvider`, `addressGroup`, `keyType`, `network`, `theme`, `mode`, and `customTheme`. These properties are used to manage the state of the Alephium Connect feature and to provide access to the current state of the feature to other components in the application.

The `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook is used to access the `AlephiumConnectContext` object from within a component. It throws an error if the hook is not used within a `Provider` component.

This file also imports several types and classes from the `@oxygenium/web3` and `../types` modules. These modules contain type definitions and classes that are used to interact with the Alephium network and to define the types of the properties in the `AlephiumConnectContext` object.

Overall, this file provides the context and hook necessary to manage the state of the Alephium Connect feature in a React application. It can be used to connect a user's wallet to the Alephium network and to perform transactions on the network. Here is an example of how the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook can be used in a component:

```
import { useAlephiumConnectContext } from './path/to/AlephiumConnectContext'

function MyComponent() {
  const { account, setAccount } = useAlephiumConnectContext()

  const handleConnect = async () => {
    // Connect to wallet and set account
    const account = await connectToWallet()
    setAccount(account)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {account ? (
        <p>Connected to {account.address}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect to Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```
