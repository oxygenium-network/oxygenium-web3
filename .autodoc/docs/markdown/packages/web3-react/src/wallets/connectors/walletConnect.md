This code defines a function called `walletConnect` that returns an object with properties representing a wallet connector. The purpose of this code is to provide a way for users to connect their wallets to the Oxygenium network. 

The function takes in an object called `_walletOptions` as an argument, but this argument is not used in the function. Instead, the function returns an object with the following properties:

- `id`: A string representing the ID of the wallet connector. In this case, it is set to `'walletConnect'`.
- `name`: A string representing the name of the wallet connector. In this case, it is set to `'Other Wallets'`.
- `logos`: An object with properties representing different logos for the wallet connector. The logos are imported from a file called `Logos` located in the `assets` directory. There are five different logos: `default`, `mobile`, `transparent`, `connectorButton`, and `qrCode`. Each logo is a React component that renders an SVG image. The `background` prop is used to determine whether the logo should have a background color or not.
- `logoBackground`: A string representing the background color of the logo. In this case, it is set to `'var(--ck-brand-walletConnect)'`.
- `scannable`: A boolean representing whether the wallet connector can be scanned. In this case, it is set to `true`.

This code is used in the larger Oxygenium project to provide a standardized way for users to connect their wallets to the network. By defining a set of properties for each wallet connector, the project can ensure that each connector has a consistent look and feel. Other files in the project can import this function and use it to display a list of available wallet connectors to the user. For example:

```
import { walletConnect } from 'oxygenium-web3'

const walletConnectProps = walletConnect()
// Display walletConnectProps in a list of available wallet connectors
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code exports a function called `walletConnect` that returns an object with properties related to a wallet integration.

2. What is the `WalletProps` type and where is it defined?
   The `WalletProps` type is imported from a file located at `./../wallet`. The definition of this type is not shown in this code snippet.

3. What is the significance of the `Logos` import and how is it used in this code?
   The `Logos` import is used to access different logos related to the wallet integration. These logos are then assigned to the `logos` property of the object returned by the `walletConnect` function.
