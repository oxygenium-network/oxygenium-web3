This file contains TypeScript code that defines two interfaces: `WalletOptions` and `WalletProps`. These interfaces are used to define the options and properties of a wallet component in the Oxygenium web3 project.

The `WalletOptions` interface defines two optional properties: `appName` and `shimDisconnect`. The `appName` property is a string that represents the name of the application that is using the wallet component. The `shimDisconnect` property is a boolean that indicates whether the wallet should disconnect from the application when it is closed.

The `WalletProps` interface defines several required properties: `id`, `name`, and `logos`, as well as several optional properties: `shortName`, `logoBackground`, `scannable`, `installed`, and `downloadUrls`. The `id` property is a string that represents the unique identifier of the wallet component. The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the wallet. The `shortName` property is an optional string that represents a shortened version of the wallet name. The `logos` property is an object that contains several ReactNode properties that represent different logos for the wallet component. The `logoBackground` property is an optional string that represents the background color of the wallet logo. The `scannable` property is an optional boolean that indicates whether the wallet can be scanned. The `installed` property is an optional boolean that indicates whether the wallet is installed. The `downloadUrls` property is an optional object that contains key-value pairs of download URLs for the wallet component.

These interfaces are used throughout the Oxygenium web3 project to define the options and properties of wallet components. For example, a developer might use these interfaces to create a new wallet component and pass in the appropriate options and properties. Here is an example of how these interfaces might be used:

```
import { WalletOptions, WalletProps } from 'oxygenium-web3'

const walletOptions: WalletOptions = {
  appName: 'My App',
  shimDisconnect: true
}

const walletProps: WalletProps = {
  id: 'my-wallet',
  name: 'My Wallet',
  shortName: 'MW',
  logos: {
    default: <MyWalletLogo />,
    transparent: <MyWalletLogoTransparent />,
    connectorButton: <MyWalletConnectorButton />,
    qrCode: <MyWalletQRCode />,
    appIcon: <MyWalletAppIcon />,
    mobile: <MyWalletMobileLogo />
  },
  logoBackground: '#FFFFFF',
  scannable: true,
  installed: true,
  downloadUrls: {
    windows: 'https://my-wallet.com/windows',
    mac: 'https://my-wallet.com/mac',
    linux: 'https://my-wallet.com/linux'
  }
}
```
