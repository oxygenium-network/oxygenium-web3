This code defines an array of supported blockchain wallet connectors for the Oxygenium project. The `supportedConnectors` array is initialized with three objects, each representing a different wallet connector. 

The first connector is called `injected` and represents a browser extension wallet. It has a `name` and `shortName` property, which are used to display the name of the wallet in different contexts. The `logos` property is an object that contains different logo components for the wallet, which are used in different contexts such as desktop and mobile. The `scannable` property is a boolean that indicates whether the wallet can be scanned by a QR code. Finally, the `extensionIsInstalled` property is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the browser extension for the wallet is installed.

The second connector is called `desktopWallet` and represents a desktop wallet. It has similar properties to the `injected` connector, but does not have an `extensionIsInstalled` property.

The third connector is called `walletConnect` and represents a wallet that uses the WalletConnect protocol. It has similar properties to the other connectors, but also has additional logo components for the connector button and QR code. It also has a `logoBackground` property that specifies the background color of the logo.

The code checks whether the `window` object is defined, which indicates that the code is running in a browser environment. If it is, the `supportedConnectors` array is initialized with the three connectors described above. Otherwise, the array remains empty.

This code is used to provide a list of supported wallet connectors to other parts of the Oxygenium project, such as the user interface. The `supportedConnectors` array can be imported and used to display a list of available wallets to the user, allowing them to choose which wallet to use for their transactions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports an array of supported connectors for the Oxygenium web3 library.

2. What is the significance of the `Logos` import?
- The `Logos` import is used to render logos for each connector in the `supportedConnectors` array.

3. What conditions must be met for the `supportedConnectors` array to be populated?
- The `supportedConnectors` array is populated only if the code is being executed in a browser environment (i.e. `typeof window != 'undefined'`).
