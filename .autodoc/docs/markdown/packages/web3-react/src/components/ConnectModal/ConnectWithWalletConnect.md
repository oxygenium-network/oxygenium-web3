This code defines a React functional component called `ConnectWithWalletConnect` that is used to connect to a wallet using the WalletConnect protocol. The component is part of the Oxygenium project and is located in the `oxygenium-web3` directory.

The component imports several modules, including `React`, `useEffect`, `useState`, and custom hooks and contexts from the Oxygenium project. It also defines a boolean variable `_init` that is used to keep track of whether the component has been initialized.

The `ConnectWithWalletConnect` component renders a `PageContent` component that contains a `Container` component. The `Container` component displays a message indicating that the component is connecting to a wallet using the WalletConnect protocol. If an error occurs during the connection process, the error message is displayed instead.

The `useEffect` hook is used to connect to the wallet using the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook. The `useConnect` hook takes an object with three properties: `addressGroup`, `keyType`, and `networkId`. These properties are used to configure the connection to the wallet.

The `useEffect` hook is only executed once, when the component is mounted. If the connection is successful, the `_init` variable is set to `true` and the error message is cleared. If an error occurs, the error message is displayed in the `Container` component.

This component is likely used in a larger project to provide users with a way to connect to a wallet using the WalletConnect protocol. The component is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into other parts of the project. Developers can customize the `addressGroup`, `keyType`, and `networkId` properties to configure the connection to the wallet.
