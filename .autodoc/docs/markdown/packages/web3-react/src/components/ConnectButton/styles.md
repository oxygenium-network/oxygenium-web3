This code defines a styled component called `TextContainer` using the `styled-components` library. The component is a `motion.div` element imported from the `framer-motion` library, which provides animation capabilities. The `TextContainer` component is designed to be used as a container for text elements, with properties that center and align the text within the container.

The `styled` function is used to create a styled component by passing in the `motion.div` element as an argument. The resulting `TextContainer` component has CSS properties applied to it, including `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `display`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, and `white-space`. These properties are used to position and style the text within the container.

The `TextContainer` component is exported as a named export, which means it can be imported and used in other files within the project. For example, if a developer wanted to create a text element that was centered and animated, they could import the `TextContainer` component and use it as a wrapper for their text element. Here is an example of how the `TextContainer` component could be used:

```
import { TextContainer } from 'oxygenium-web3'

const MyText = () => {
  return (
    <TextContainer animate={{ scale: 1.2 }} transition={{ duration: 1 }}>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </TextContainer>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `TextContainer` component is used to wrap an `h1` element that says "Hello World!". The `animate` and `transition` props are passed to the `TextContainer` component to provide animation effects. When the component is rendered, the text will be centered within the container and will scale up by 20% over a duration of 1 second.

Overall, this code provides a reusable component for text elements that need to be centered and animated within a container. It demonstrates the use of styled components and the `framer-motion` library to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.
