This file contains code related to the balance display of the Oxygenium web application. It imports the necessary dependencies and exports three styled components: `BalanceContainer`, `Balance`, and `LoadingBalance`.

`BalanceContainer` is a styled component that wraps around the `Balance` component. It is used to position the balance display on the web page.

`Balance` is a styled component that displays the balance of the user's account. It is a child component of `BalanceContainer`.

`LoadingBalance` is a styled component that displays a loading animation while the balance is being fetched from the server. It is also a child component of `BalanceContainer`.

The `PlaceholderKeyframes` constant is a keyframe animation that is used to animate the loading animation in `LoadingBalance`. It animates the background of the component to create a loading effect.

This code is part of the larger Oxygenium web application and is responsible for displaying the user's balance. The `Balance` component is rendered with the user's balance once it is fetched from the server. If the balance has not yet been fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is rendered instead. This provides a visual cue to the user that the balance is being loaded.

Here is an example of how these components might be used in the larger Oxygenium web application:

```
import { BalanceContainer, Balance, LoadingBalance } from 'oxygenium-web3'

function AccountBalance() {
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchBalance()
  }, [])

  async function fetchBalance() {
    const balance = await fetch('/api/balance')
    setBalance(balance)
    setLoading(false)
  }

  return (
    <BalanceContainer>
      {loading ? (
        <LoadingBalance />
      ) : (
        <Balance>{balance}</Balance>
      )}
    </BalanceContainer>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `AccountBalance` component fetches the user's balance from the server and displays it using the `Balance` component. While the balance is being fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is displayed instead. The `BalanceContainer` component is used to position the balance display on the web page.
