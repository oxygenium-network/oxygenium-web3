This code defines a React component called `Connectors` that renders a list of supported wallet connectors. The component is part of the Alephium Web3 project and is used to allow users to connect their wallets to the Alephium network.

The component imports the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook from the `oxygeniumConnect` context, which provides access to the current connector and route. It also imports the `supportedConnectors` constant, which is an array of objects that define the various wallet connectors that are supported by the Alephium network.

The `Connectors` component renders a list of wallet connectors based on the user's device type (mobile or desktop). For mobile devices, the list is rendered as a series of buttons, while for desktop devices, the list is rendered as a series of icons with labels.

Each wallet connector is represented by a `ConnectorButton` or `MobileConnectorButton` component, which contains an icon and a label. When a user clicks on a connector button, the `setConnectorId` function is called with the ID of the selected connector, and the `setRoute` function is called with the `routes.CONNECT` constant, which sets the current route to the connect page.

The `findInjectedConnectorInfo` function is a helper function that is used to find information about injected wallet connectors. It takes a wallet name and an array of wallet objects as arguments and returns the first wallet object that matches the name.

Overall, this code provides a simple and intuitive way for users to connect their wallets to the Alephium network. By rendering a list of supported wallet connectors and allowing users to select the one they want to use, the `Connectors` component makes it easy for users to get started with the Alephium network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a React component called `Connectors` that renders a list of supported wallet connectors for the Alephium project, with different styles for mobile and desktop views.

2. What is the license for this code?
- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

3. What are some of the supported wallet connectors and how are they displayed?
- The supported wallet connectors are defined in the `supportedConnectors` constant and include `injected`, `walletConnect`, and `desktopWallet`. They are displayed as buttons with icons and labels, and some of the labels are customized based on the connector type. The icons and labels are determined by the `logos` and `name` properties of the connector object, and in some cases, additional logic is used to find the appropriate logos and names based on the user's installed wallets.
