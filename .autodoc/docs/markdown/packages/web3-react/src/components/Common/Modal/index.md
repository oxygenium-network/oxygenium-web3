The `Modal` component in this code is a part of the Oxygenium-web3 project and serves as a reusable, customizable modal dialog with various features such as transitions, animations, and focus trapping. It is designed to be used in different parts of the project with different content and actions.

The `Modal` component accepts several props, including `open`, `pages`, `pageId`, `positionInside`, `inline`, `onClose`, `onBack`, and `onInfo`. These props control the modal's visibility, content, positioning, and event handlers for closing, going back, and showing more information.

The `Page` component is used to render each page within the modal, and it handles the transition states and animations for entering and exiting the page. The `OrDivider` component is a simple styled divider with a customizable text, typically used to separate different sections or actions within the modal.

The `Modal` component uses the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the `framer-motion` library to handle animations and transitions. It also uses custom hooks like `useTransition`, `useFocusTrap`, and `usePrevious` to manage the modal's state, focus management, and previous values.

Here's an example of how the `Modal` component can be used:

```jsx
import Modal, { routes, OrDivider } from './Modal';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleModalClose = () => {
    setModalOpen(false);
  };

  const pages = [
    {
      id: routes.CONNECTORS,
      content: <div>Connectors Content</div>,
    },
    {
      id: routes.PROFILE,
      content: <div>Profile Content</div>,
    },
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      <Modal
        open={modalOpen}
        pages={pages}
        pageId={routes.CONNECTORS}
        onClose={handleModalClose}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

In this example, a button is used to open the modal, and the `handleModalClose` function is passed as the `onClose` prop to close the modal. The `pages` array contains the content for each page within the modal, and the `pageId` prop is set to display the "Connectors" page initially.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `oxygenium-web3` project?**

   The code provided does not give a clear indication of the overall purpose of the `oxygenium-web3` project. However, it appears to be a React-based web application that involves connecting to different connectors, profiles, and other features.

2. **What are the different routes available in the `routes` object and how are they used?**

   The `routes` object contains three keys: `CONNECTORS`, `PROFILE`, and `CONNECT`. These keys represent different pages or views within the application. The `Modal` component takes a `pageId` prop, which is used to determine the currently active page and render its content accordingly.

3. **How does the `Modal` component handle transitions between pages?**

   The `Modal` component uses the `useTransition` hook from the `react-transition-state` library to manage transitions between pages. It also uses the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the `framer-motion` library to handle animations and transitions for various elements within the component. The `contentVariants` object defines the initial, animate, and exit states for the content transitions.
