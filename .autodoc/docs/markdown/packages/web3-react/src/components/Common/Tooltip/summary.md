The `Tooltip` component in the `oxygenium-web3` project provides a customizable and visually appealing tooltip window that can be used throughout the project to enhance the user experience. The component is defined in the `index.tsx` file and uses several React hooks to manage its state and layout. It also uses the `motion` component from the `framer-motion` library for animations and the `Portal` component to render the tooltip window outside the current React tree.

The `Tooltip` component accepts several props, such as `message`, `open`, `xOffset`, `yOffset`, and `delay`. These props allow developers to customize the tooltip's content, visibility, position, and display delay. For example:

```jsx
import Tooltip from 'oxygenium-web3/components/Tooltip'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Tooltip message="Hello, world!" xOffset={10} yOffset={-10}>
      <button>Hover me</button>
    </Tooltip>
  )
}
```

This example renders a button that displays a tooltip window with the message "Hello, world!" when the user hovers over it. The tooltip window will be positioned 10 pixels to the right and 10 pixels above the button.

The `styles.ts` file contains styled components for the tooltip window, such as `TooltipWindow`, `TooltipContainer`, and `TooltipTail`. These components are styled using CSS variables and the `styled` function from the `styled-components` library. This allows for easy creation of reusable styled components that can be used throughout the Oxygenium web3 project.

The `types.ts` file contains TypeScript type definitions for the tooltip component, such as `TooltipSizeProps` and `TooltipProps`. These type definitions ensure that the tooltip component is used correctly throughout the Oxygenium project and make it easier to maintain and update the component in the future.

In summary, the `Tooltip` component in the `oxygenium-web3` project provides a flexible and visually appealing way to display additional information when the user hovers over a specific element on the page. The component is defined in the `index.tsx` file, styled in the `styles.ts` file, and has its types defined in the `types.ts` file. This modular approach makes it easy to maintain and update the tooltip component as the project evolves.
