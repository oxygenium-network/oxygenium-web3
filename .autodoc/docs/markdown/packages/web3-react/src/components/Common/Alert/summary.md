The `Alert` component in the `index.tsx` file is a reusable React component designed to display alerts on a web page. It accepts two props: `children` and `icon`. The `children` prop is used to pass the content of the alert, while the `icon` prop is used to pass an optional icon to be displayed alongside the content. The component is defined using `React.forwardRef`, allowing it to forward a ref to one of its children, which can be useful for accessing the DOM node of a child element.

The `styles.ts` file defines two styled components, `AlertContainer` and `IconContainer`, which are used to create alert messages with icons. The `AlertContainer` component is a flex container with a gap of 8px between its child elements and has a position of relative and a border radius of 9px. The `IconContainer` component is a container for the icon that appears in the alert message, with a fixed width and height of 24px and its child elements centered both horizontally and vertically.

The `types.ts` file defines a TypeScript type called `AlertProps`, which is an object that can have two properties: `children` and `icon`. Both properties are of type `React.ReactNode`, which means they can accept any valid React node as their value. This type is used in components that display alerts or notifications to the user, ensuring consistent props and easy maintenance and updates.

Here's an example of how the `Alert` component can be used in a parent component:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Alert from 'oxygenium-web3/Alert'

function MyComponent() {
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)

  function handleButtonClick() {
    try {
      // some code that might throw an error
    } catch (error) {
      setError(error.message)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>
      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message. Finally, the component renders an `Alert` component with the `error` message as its content, which is displayed to the user.
