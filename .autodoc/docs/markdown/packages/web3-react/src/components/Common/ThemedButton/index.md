The `ThemedButton` component is a React functional component that renders a button with a customizable theme. It takes in several props, including `children`, which is the content of the button, `variant`, which determines the color scheme of the button, `autoSize`, which determines whether the button should automatically adjust its width to fit its content, `duration`, which determines the duration of the animation when the button is clicked, and `style`, which allows for additional custom styling.

The component uses the `useMeasure` hook from the `react-use-measure` library to measure the size of the button content and adjust the button width accordingly. The `Container` component is a styled component that renders the button with the appropriate theme and animation. The `ThemeContainer` component is also exported, but it is not used in this file.

This component can be used in a larger project to render customizable buttons with different color schemes and animations. For example, it could be used in a web application to render a primary button with a blue color scheme and a secondary button with a gray color scheme. The `autoSize` prop could be set to `false` for buttons with fixed widths, and the `duration` prop could be adjusted to change the animation speed. Overall, this component provides a flexible and reusable way to render buttons with different styles and behaviors. 

Example usage:

```
import ThemedButton from './ThemedButton'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton variant="primary" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>
        Click me!
      </ThemedButton>
      <ThemedButton variant="secondary" autoSize={false}>
        Fixed width button
      </ThemedButton>
    </div>
  )
}
```
