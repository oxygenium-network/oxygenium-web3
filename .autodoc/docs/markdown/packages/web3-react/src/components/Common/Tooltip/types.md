This file contains two TypeScript type definitions for a tooltip component that can be used in the Oxygenium project. The first type definition, `TooltipSizeProps`, is a union type that specifies the possible sizes of the tooltip. The two possible values are `'small'` and `'large'`. 

The second type definition, `TooltipProps`, specifies the props that can be passed to the tooltip component. These props include:

- `message`: A string or React node that represents the content of the tooltip.
- `children`: A React node that represents the element that the tooltip is attached to.
- `open`: A boolean that determines whether the tooltip is currently visible.
- `xOffset`: A number that specifies the horizontal offset of the tooltip from its attached element.
- `yOffset`: A number that specifies the vertical offset of the tooltip from its attached element.
- `delay`: A number that specifies the delay (in milliseconds) before the tooltip is displayed.

These type definitions can be used to ensure that the tooltip component is used correctly throughout the Oxygenium project. For example, when defining a tooltip component, the `TooltipProps` type can be used to specify the expected props:

```typescript
import { TooltipProps } from 'oxygenium-web3'

const MyTooltip = ({ message, children, open, xOffset, yOffset, delay }: TooltipProps) => {
  // ...
}
```

Overall, this file provides a useful abstraction for creating and using tooltips in the Oxygenium project, making it easier to maintain and update the tooltip component in the future.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file?
- This file contains a type definition for `TooltipProps` and `TooltipSizeProps`, which are used for defining the props of a tooltip component.

2. What are the possible values for `TooltipSizeProps`?
- The possible values for `TooltipSizeProps` are `'small'` and `'large'`.

3. What are the optional props that can be passed to the `TooltipProps` type?
- The optional props that can be passed to the `TooltipProps` type are `message`, `children`, `open`, `xOffset`, `yOffset`, and `delay`.
