This file contains several React components that render SVG icons for the Oxygenium project. The components are `OxygeniumIcon`, `WalletConnect`, `Ledger`, and `PlaceHolder`. 

`OxygeniumIcon` renders the Oxygenium logo, which consists of three shapes. The logo is used as a visual identifier for the Oxygenium project.

`WalletConnect` renders an icon for the WalletConnect protocol, which is used to connect decentralized applications to mobile wallets. The icon is a stylized "W" with a circle around it. The component takes an optional `background` prop, which, when set to `true`, adds a background color to the icon.

`Ledger` renders an icon for the Ledger hardware wallet, which is used to store cryptocurrency securely. The icon is a stylized "L" with a circle around it. The component has a black background.

`PlaceHolder` is a simple component that renders a gray square with a width and height of 80 pixels. It is used as a placeholder for components that have not yet been implemented.

These components are used throughout the Oxygenium project to provide visual cues and branding. They can be imported into other React components and used like any other React component. For example, to use the `WalletConnect` icon in a component, you would import it like this:

```
import { WalletConnect } from 'oxygenium-web3'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <WalletConnect />
    </div>
  )
}
```
