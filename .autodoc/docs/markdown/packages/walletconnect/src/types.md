This file defines several types and interfaces that are used in the Oxygenium Web3 project. It also imports various modules and constants that are used throughout the project. 

The `RelayMethodsTable` type defines a table of methods that can be called by a relay. Each method has a set of parameters and a result type. The `RelayMethodParams` and `RelayMethodResult` types are used to extract the parameter and result types for a specific method. 

The `ProviderEventArguments` type defines the arguments that can be passed to a provider event. The `ProviderEvent` type is used to specify the type of event that is being handled, and the `ProviderEventArgument` type is used to extract the argument type for a specific event. 

The `AddressGroup` type is used to specify a specific address group or all address groups. The `ChainInfo` interface defines the network ID and address group for a specific chain. 

The `ProjectMetaData` type is used to store metadata about a project. 

Overall, this file provides a set of types and interfaces that are used throughout the Oxygenium Web3 project to ensure type safety and consistency.
