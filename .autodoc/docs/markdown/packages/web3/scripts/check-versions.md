This code is a Node.js script that checks if the version of Node.js installed on the user's machine matches the version expected by the Oxygenium blockchain explorer backend. The script takes two arguments: the first argument is the version of Node.js installed on the user's machine, and the second argument is the version of the explorer backend that the user wants to use. 

The script first defines a function called `extractNodeVersionFromExplorer` that takes the explorer version as an argument and returns the expected version of Node.js. This function extracts the expected Node.js version from a Scala file in the explorer-backend repository on GitHub. It does this by constructing a URL to the file based on the explorer version, fetching the file contents using the `fetch` function from the `cross-fetch` library, and then using a regular expression to extract the expected Node.js version from the file contents. 

The script then defines a `main` function that reads the two arguments passed to the script, calls `extractNodeVersionFromExplorer` to get the expected Node.js version, and compares it to the actual Node.js version installed on the user's machine. If the two versions do not match, the script prints an error message to the console and exits with a non-zero status code. 

This script is likely used as part of the build or deployment process for the Oxygenium blockchain explorer backend. By checking that the user has the correct version of Node.js installed, the script ensures that the backend will run correctly and avoids potential issues caused by version mismatches. The script could be invoked manually by a developer or as part of an automated build or deployment pipeline. 

Example usage:

```
$ node check-node-version.js 14.17.0 1.2.3
Invalid node version: the configured explorer-backend version (1.2.3) expects node 14.16.0.
Instead, the configured node version is 14.17.0
Please, check that the configured node and explorer-backend versions in the package.json are correct.
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to extract the node version from a specific URL and compare it with the node version configured in the package.json file.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code requires the `cross-fetch` library to make HTTP requests and the `process` module to access command-line arguments.

3. What license is this code released under?
