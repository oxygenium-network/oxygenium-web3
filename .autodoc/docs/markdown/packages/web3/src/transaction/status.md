This file contains TypeScript code that defines a class and a function related to subscribing to transaction status updates in the Alephium blockchain network. The code imports the `web3` and `node` modules from other parts of the `oxygenium-web3` project, as well as a `Subscription` class and `SubscribeOptions` type from a `utils` module.

The `TxStatusSubscription` class extends the `Subscription` class and defines a constructor that takes in a `SubscribeOptions` object, a transaction ID string, and optional `fromGroup` and `toGroup` numbers. The `TxStatusSubscription` instance starts polling for transaction status updates as soon as it is created. The `polling` method of the class uses the `web3` module to get the transaction status from the current node provider and calls the `messageCallback` method of the `Subscription` class with the status as an argument. If an error occurs, the `errorCallback` method of the `Subscription` class is called with the error and the `TxStatusSubscription` instance as arguments.

The `subscribeToTxStatus` function is a wrapper around the `TxStatusSubscription` class constructor that creates and returns a new `TxStatusSubscription` instance with the given arguments.

Overall, this code provides a way for developers to subscribe to transaction status updates in the Alephium blockchain network. The `TxStatusSubscription` class can be used to create a subscription instance that polls for updates and calls a callback function with the status when it changes. The `subscribeToTxStatus` function provides a simpler way to create a subscription by wrapping the `TxStatusSubscription` constructor. This code is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the `oxygenium-web3` project to build decentralized applications on the Alephium network.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code defines a class `TxStatusSubscription` and a function `subscribeToTxStatus` that allow developers to subscribe to transaction status updates on the Alephium blockchain.

2. What is the license for this code and where can I find more information about it?
   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, and developers can find more information about it at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

3. What are the parameters for the `TxStatusSubscription` constructor and the `subscribeToTxStatus` function?
   - Both the `TxStatusSubscription` constructor and the `subscribeToTxStatus` function take in a `SubscribeOptions` object, a `txId` string, and optional `fromGroup` and `toGroup` numbers as parameters. The `SubscribeOptions` object is used to configure the subscription, while the `txId` string identifies the transaction for which the developer wants to receive status updates. The `fromGroup` and `toGroup` numbers are optional and specify the range of block groups to search for the transaction status.
