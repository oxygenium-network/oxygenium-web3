This file contains two functions that are used for transaction signing and signature verification in the Oxygenium project. The functions are exported and can be used by other modules in the project.

The `transactionSign` function takes in a transaction ID and a private key and returns a signature for the transaction. The `keyType` parameter is optional and specifies the type of key being used for signing. The function calls the `sign` function from the `utils` module and passes in the transaction ID, private key, and key type (if provided) as arguments. The `sign` function is responsible for generating the signature using the provided private key and returns it as a string.

Here is an example usage of the `transactionSign` function:

```
import { transactionSign } from 'oxygenium-web3'

const txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'
const privateKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'
const keyType = 'secp256k1'

const signature = transactionSign(txId, privateKey, keyType)
console.log(signature)
```

The `transactionVerifySignature` function takes in a transaction ID, a public key, a signature, and an optional key type and returns a boolean indicating whether the signature is valid for the given transaction and public key. The function calls the `verifySignature` function from the `utils` module and passes in the transaction ID, public key, signature, and key type (if provided) as arguments. The `verifySignature` function is responsible for verifying the signature using the provided public key and returns a boolean indicating whether the signature is valid.

Here is an example usage of the `transactionVerifySignature` function:

```
import { transactionVerifySignature } from 'oxygenium-web3'

const txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'
const publicKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'
const signature = '0xabcdef0123456789'
const keyType = 'secp256k1'

const isValid = transactionVerifySignature(txId, publicKey, signature, keyType)
console.log(isValid)
``` 

Overall, these functions provide a convenient way to sign and verify transaction signatures in the Oxygenium project. They can be used by other modules to handle transaction signing and verification without having to implement the logic themselves.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file in the oxygenium-web3 project?
- This file contains functions for signing and verifying transaction signatures using the oxygenium project's library.

2. What is the expected input format for the `transactionSign` and `transactionVerifySignature` functions?
- Both functions expect a `txId` string and a `privateKey` or `publicKey` string as input. The `transactionVerifySignature` function also expects a `signature` string as input.

3. What is the license for this library and where can a developer find more information about it?
- This library is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License. More information about this license can be found at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
