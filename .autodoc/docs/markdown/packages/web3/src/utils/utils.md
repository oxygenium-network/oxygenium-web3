This file contains utility functions and constants used in the Oxygenium project. 

The `encodeSignature` function takes an elliptic curve signature object and returns a hex string representation of the signature. The `encodeHexSignature` function takes two hex strings representing the `r` and `s` values of a signature and returns a hex string representation of the signature. The `signatureDecode` function takes an elliptic curve object and a hex string representation of a signature and returns an object with `r` and `s` properties. 

The `xorByte` function takes an integer value and returns the XOR of its four bytes. The `isHexString` function takes a string and returns `true` if it is a valid hex string. 

The `groupOfAddress` function takes an Oxygenium address and returns the group number to which the address belongs. The `groupOfPrivateKey` function takes a private key and returns the group number to which the corresponding public key belongs. The `publicKeyFromPrivateKey` function takes a private key and returns the corresponding public key. The `addressFromPublicKey` function takes a public key and returns the corresponding Oxygenium address. The `addressFromContractId` function takes a contract ID and returns the corresponding Oxygenium address. The `addressFromTokenId` function takes a token ID and returns the corresponding Oxygenium address. The `contractIdFromTx` function takes a transaction ID and an output index and returns the corresponding contract ID. The `subContractId` function takes a parent contract ID, a path in hex format, and a group number, and returns a sub-contract ID. The `blockChainIndex` function takes a block hash and returns the "from" and "to" group numbers of the corresponding blockchain index. 

The file also contains utility functions for converting between hex strings and binary data (`hexToBinUnsafe` and `binToHex`), for sleeping for a specified number of milliseconds (`sleep`), and for converting strings to hex and vice versa (`stringToHex` and `hexToString`). 

Finally, the file defines some types and constants used throughout the project, such as `networkIds`, `AddressType`, and `KeyType`.
