This file contains TypeScript code for the `SignerProvider` class and several related classes and functions. These classes and functions are used to interact with a blockchain network and sign transactions and messages. 

The `SignerProvider` class is an abstract class that defines the interface for interacting with a signer provider. It has several abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. These methods include `getSelectedAccount`, `signAndSubmitTransferTx`, `signAndSubmitDeployContractTx`, `signAndSubmitExecuteScriptTx`, `signAndSubmitUnsignedTx`, `signUnsignedTx`, and `signMessage`. 

The `InteractiveSignerProvider` class is a subclass of `SignerProvider` that is used for interactive signers, such as a wallet connect instance or an extension wallet object. It has an additional abstract method `unsafeEnable` that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. 

The `SignerProviderSimple` class is a subclass of `SignerProvider` that is used for simple signer providers. It has an abstract method `getPublicKey` that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. It also has several concrete methods for signing and submitting transactions, including `signAndSubmitTransferTx`, `signAndSubmitDeployContractTx`, `signAndSubmitExecuteScriptTx`, `signAndSubmitUnsignedTx`, `signTransferTx`, `signDeployContractTx`, `signExecuteScriptTx`, `signUnsignedTx`, and `signRaw`. 

The `SignerProviderWithMultipleAccounts` class is a subclass of `SignerProviderSimple` that is used for signer providers that support multiple accounts. It has additional abstract methods `setSelectedAccount` and `getAccounts` that must be implemented by any concrete subclass. 

The `SignerProviderWithCachedAccounts` class is a subclass of `SignerProviderWithMultipleAccounts` that is used for signer providers that cache account information. It has additional methods for managing cached accounts, including `unsafeGetSelectedAccount`, `getAccount`, and `setSelectedAccount`. 

The file also includes several utility functions, including `extendMessage`, `hashMessage`, `verifySignedMessage`, `toApiDestination`, `toApiDestinations`, `fromApiDestination`, and `fromApiDestinations`. These functions are used for extending and hashing messages, verifying signed messages, and converting between different data formats.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SignerProvider` class and its subclasses?
- The `SignerProvider` class and its subclasses provide an abstraction for interacting with a signer, such as a wallet or extension, to sign and submit transactions on the Oxygenium network.

2. What is the `hashMessage` function used for?
- The `hashMessage` function is used to hash a message using a specified hashing algorithm, such as blake2b or sha256, and return the result in hexadecimal format.

3. What is the purpose of the `toApiDestination` and `fromApiDestination` functions?
- The `toApiDestination` and `fromApiDestination` functions are used to convert between the `Destination` type used in the `SignerProvider` class and the `node.Destination` type used in the Oxygenium API.
