This file contains code that sets and gets the current node and explorer providers for the Alephium project. The `NodeProvider` and `ExplorerProvider` classes are imported from the `api` module. 

The `setCurrentNodeProvider` function sets the current node provider. It takes either a `NodeProvider` object or a base URL string, an optional API key string, and an optional custom fetch function. If a string is passed, a new `NodeProvider` object is created with the provided parameters. Otherwise, the provided `NodeProvider` object is set as the current node provider. 

The `getCurrentNodeProvider` function returns the current node provider. If no node provider is set, an error is thrown. 

The `setCurrentExplorerProvider` function sets the current explorer provider. It takes either an `ExplorerProvider` object or a base URL string, an optional API key string, and an optional custom fetch function. If a string is passed, a new `ExplorerProvider` object is created with the provided parameters. Otherwise, the provided `ExplorerProvider` object is set as the current explorer provider. 

The `getCurrentExplorerProvider` function returns the current explorer provider. Unlike `getCurrentNodeProvider`, this function may return `undefined` if no explorer provider is set. 

These functions are used to manage the current node and explorer providers for the Alephium project. By setting the current providers, other modules in the project can easily access them without having to create new instances. For example, a module that needs to make API calls to the current node provider can simply call `getCurrentNodeProvider()` to get the current provider object. 

Here is an example of how these functions might be used in a larger project:

```
import { setCurrentNodeProvider, getCurrentNodeProvider } from 'oxygenium-web3'

// Set the current node provider
setCurrentNodeProvider('https://my-node.com', 'my-api-key')

// Get the current node provider
const nodeProvider = getCurrentNodeProvider()

// Use the node provider to make an API call
const response = await nodeProvider.makeApiCall('/my-endpoint')
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file contains functions related to setting and getting the current node and explorer providers for the Alephium project's web3 API.

2. What is the difference between `NodeProvider` and `ExplorerProvider`?
   - `NodeProvider` is required for all applications and is used to interact with the Alephium blockchain, while `ExplorerProvider` is not necessary for all applications and may return `undefined`. It is used to interact with the Alephium block explorer.

3. What license is this code released under?
   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.
