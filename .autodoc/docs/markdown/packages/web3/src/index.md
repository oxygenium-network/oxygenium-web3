This code is a file that is part of the Oxygenium project and contains various exports related to web3 functionality. The purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for importing all the necessary modules related to web3 functionality in the Oxygenium project.

The first part of the code is a license and copyright notice that specifies the terms under which the library can be used and distributed. The next line adds a new method to the BigInt prototype called `toJSON`, which returns a string representation of the BigInt object.

The next set of lines contains a series of export statements that make various modules available for use in other parts of the project. These modules include `api`, `contract`, `signer`, `utils`, `transaction`, and `token`. These modules provide functionality related to interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain, such as sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, and managing tokens.

The next set of export statements includes `constants` and `web3`. `constants` exports various constants used throughout the project, while `web3` exports a global object that can be used to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain.

Finally, the last export statement exports the `utils` module again, but this time under the name `utils`. This allows for easy access to the `utils` module without having to specify the full path.

Overall, this file provides a convenient way to import all the necessary web3-related modules for the Oxygenium project. By importing this file, developers can easily access all the functionality they need to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain. For example, a developer could import this file and then use the `transaction` module to send a transaction on the Oxygenium blockchain:

```
import { transaction } from 'oxygenium-web3'

const tx = await transaction.send({
  from: '0x123...',
  to: '0x456...',
  value: 1000
})
```
