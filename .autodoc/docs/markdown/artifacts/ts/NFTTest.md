This code defines a contract factory and a contract instance for a smart contract called NFTTest. The contract is defined using the Oxygenium Web3 library, which provides a set of functions and types for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain.

The NFTTest contract has two methods: getTokenUri and getCollectionId. The getTokenUri method returns the URI of a token, while the getCollectionId method returns the ID of the collection that the token belongs to. Both methods take no arguments.

The NFTTest contract is defined using a JSON file that contains the contract's bytecode and ABI. The contract factory is used to deploy the contract to the blockchain and to create instances of the contract. The contract instance is used to interact with the deployed contract on the blockchain.

The code also defines custom types for the contract, which are used to specify the types of the contract's fields, state, and methods. These types are used to ensure type safety when interacting with the contract.

The code provides a set of functions for testing and interacting with the contract. The tests object in the contract factory provides functions for testing the getTokenUri and getCollectionId methods. The NFTTestInstance class provides functions for calling the getTokenUri and getCollectionId methods on a deployed contract instance. The multicall function allows multiple contract method calls to be made in a single transaction.

Overall, this code provides a set of functions and types for interacting with the NFTTest contract on the Oxygenium blockchain. It can be used as a building block for more complex applications that require interaction with smart contracts on the Oxygenium blockchain.
