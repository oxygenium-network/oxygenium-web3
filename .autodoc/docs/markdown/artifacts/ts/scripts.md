This file is an autogenerated script that exports four namespaces: DestroyAdd, GreeterMain, Main, and MintNFTTest. Each namespace exports an `execute` function and a `script` object. The `execute` function takes a `SignerProvider` and an `ExecuteScriptParams` object as input and returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `ExecuteScriptResult` object. The `script` object contains a JSON representation of a script that can be executed on the Oxygenium blockchain.

The purpose of this file is to provide a convenient way to execute pre-defined scripts on the Oxygenium blockchain. Each namespace corresponds to a different script, and the `execute` function takes care of signing and submitting the transaction to the blockchain. The `script` object contains the JSON representation of the script that is being executed.

For example, to execute the `DestroyAdd` script, you would call the `execute` function on the `DestroyAdd` namespace, passing in a `SignerProvider` and an `ExecuteScriptParams` object. The `SignerProvider` is responsible for signing the transaction, and the `ExecuteScriptParams` object contains the parameters that are passed to the script. The `execute` function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `ExecuteScriptResult` object, which contains information about the execution of the script.

Here is an example of how to execute the `DestroyAdd` script:

```typescript
import { DestroyAdd } from "@oxygenium/web3";

const signer = ...; // create a SignerProvider
const params = { add: "0x123456789abcdef", caller: "0x987654321fedcba" }; // set the parameters
const result = await DestroyAdd.execute(signer, params); // execute the script
console.log(result); // print the result
```

Overall, this file provides a convenient way to execute pre-defined scripts on the Oxygenium blockchain, making it easier for developers to interact with the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains namespaces and functions for executing scripts related to different contracts in the Oxygenium blockchain.

2. What are the parameters required for the `execute` function in each namespace?
- The `execute` function in each namespace requires a `signer` object and `params` object with specific properties depending on the namespace. For example, the `DestroyAdd` namespace requires `params` to have an `add` property of type `HexString` and a `caller` property of type `Address`.

3. What is the role of the `Script` object in each namespace?
- The `Script` object in each namespace is used to parse a JSON file containing the script code for the corresponding contract. The resulting `Script` object is then used to generate transaction parameters and sign and submit the transaction using the `signer` object.
