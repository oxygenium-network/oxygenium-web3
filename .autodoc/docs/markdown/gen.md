This code is responsible for generating code artifacts for the Alephium project using the Alephium Web3 library. The Alephium project is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a scalable and secure infrastructure for decentralized applications. The Alephium Web3 library is a JavaScript library that provides a set of APIs for interacting with the Alephium blockchain.

The code starts by importing the necessary modules from the Alephium Web3 library. The `Project` class is used to build the project and generate the code artifacts. The `codegen` function is used to generate the code artifacts. The `web3` object is used to set the current node provider to `http://127.0.0.1:22973`.

The `gen` function is an asynchronous function that sets the current node provider to `http://127.0.0.1:22973` using the `setCurrentNodeProvider` method of the `web3` object. It then builds the project using the `Project.build` method with the `errorOnWarnings` option set to `false`. Finally, it generates the code artifacts using the `codegen` function with the output directory set to `./artifacts`.

This code can be used to generate code artifacts for the Alephium project. Code artifacts are generated from the smart contracts written in Solidity, which are then compiled into bytecode and ABI files. These files are used by developers to interact with the smart contracts on the Alephium blockchain. The generated code artifacts can be used in various programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java.

Here is an example of how this code can be used in a larger project:

```javascript
const { gen } = require('@oxygenium/web3-gen')

async function build() {
  await gen()
  // other build steps
}

build()
```

In this example, the `gen` function is imported from the `@oxygenium/web3-gen` module, which is a wrapper around the code in this file. The `build` function is an asynchronous function that calls the `gen` function to generate the code artifacts and then performs other build steps. The `build` function is then called to start the build process.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file is used to generate code artifacts for the Alephium project using the `@oxygenium/web3` and `@oxygenium/cli` libraries.

2. What license is this code file released under?
   - This code file is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

3. What is the significance of the `web3.setCurrentNodeProvider` function call?
   - The `web3.setCurrentNodeProvider` function call sets the node provider for the Alephium web3 library to a local node running on `http://127.0.0.1:22973`. This is necessary for generating the code artifacts.
