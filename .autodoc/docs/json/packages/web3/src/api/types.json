  "summary": "This file contains utility functions and type definitions for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain through its web3 API. The file defines several functions for converting between different data types used in the API and the corresponding JavaScript types. It also defines functions for parsing API responses and converting them into JavaScript objects.\n\nThe file defines several type aliases, including `Number256`, which represents a 256-bit integer, and `Val`, which represents a value that can be passed to or returned from an API call. The `NamedVals` type is a record of named `Val` values.\n\nThe `Token` interface represents a token on the Oxygenium blockchain, with an `id` string and an `amount` of `Number256` type. The file defines functions for converting between `Token` objects and the corresponding `node.Token` objects used in the API.\n\nThe file also defines functions for converting between JavaScript boolean values and the `Bool` type used in the API, as well as between JavaScript strings and the `ByteVec` and `Address` types used in the API.\n\nThe `toApiArray` function converts a JavaScript array to an `Array` type used in the API, with the specified base type and dimensions. The `fromApiArray` function converts an `Array` type from the API to a JavaScript array.\n\nThe `fromApiVals` function parses an array of `node.Val` objects returned from an API call, using the specified names and types to create a `NamedVals` object. The `fromApiVal` function converts a single `node.Val` object to a JavaScript value of the specified type.\n\nThe file also defines utility functions for forwarding API requests to a handler function, and for making API requests using a provider object and an `ApiRequestArguments` object.\n\nFinally, the file defines the `TokenMetaData` interface, which represents metadata for a token on the Oxygenium blockchain, including its name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file in the oxygenium-web3 project?\n- This file contains utility functions for converting between different data types used in the project and the corresponding types used in the Oxygenium API.\n\n2. What is the license for this library?\n- The library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the format of the TokenMetaData interface?\n- The TokenMetaData interface has four properties: name (string), symbol (string), decimals (number), and totalSupply (Number256)."
