  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of a NodeProvider class that serves as a wrapper around the Oxygenium node API. The NodeProvider class provides a convenient way to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain by exposing methods that correspond to various API endpoints. \n\nThe NodeProvider class is initialized with a base URL for the Oxygenium node API, an optional API key, and an optional customFetch function. The class then creates an instance of the NodeApi class, which is responsible for making HTTP requests to the Oxygenium node API. \n\nThe NodeProvider class exposes methods that correspond to various API endpoints, such as wallets, infos, blockflow, addresses, transactions, mempool, contracts, multisig, utils, miners, and events. These methods are implemented by forwarding requests to the corresponding methods of the underlying NodeApi instance. \n\nThe NodeProvider class also provides a request method that can be used to make arbitrary API requests. This method takes an ApiRequestArguments object as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the API. \n\nThe NodeProvider class also provides two static methods, Proxy and Remote, that can be used to create instances of the NodeProvider class that forward requests to another NodeProvider instance or to a custom API request handler, respectively. \n\nFinally, the NodeProvider class provides two utility methods, fetchStdTokenMetaData and guessStdInterfaceId, that can be used to fetch metadata for standard tokens and to guess the interface ID of a token, respectively. These methods are implemented by making requests to the contracts endpoint of the Oxygenium node API. \n\nOverall, the NodeProvider class provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain through the Oxygenium node API.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines a NodeProvider class that acts as a proxy for interacting with an Oxygenium node API.\n\n2. What is the license for this code?\n- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `fetchStdTokenMetaData` and `guessStdInterfaceId` methods?\n- These methods are used to fetch metadata for a standard token and to guess the interface ID for a standard token, respectively."
