  "summary": "This file contains utility functions for making HTTP requests to an API and handling rate limiting and retries. The functions are designed to be used in the larger Oxygenium project, which likely involves interacting with an external API.\n\nThe `convertHttpResponse` function takes an HTTP response object and returns the data from the response. If the response contains an error, it throws an error with the error detail message.\n\nThe `retryFetch` function takes the same parameters as the built-in `fetch` function and attempts to make a request. If the response status is 429 (Too Many Requests), the function waits for a certain amount of time and retries the request up to a certain number of times. This is useful for handling rate limiting from the API. The function returns a promise that resolves to the response object.\n\nThe `throttledFetch` function takes a rate limit in requests per second and returns a custom `fetch` function that is rate-limited and retries requests as necessary. The function uses the `RateLimit` class from the `async-sema` library to limit the rate of requests. The returned function has the same parameters as the built-in `fetch` function and returns a promise that resolves to the response object.\n\nThe constants `RETRY_LIMIT_WHEN_429`, `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT`, and `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_FETCH` are also defined in this file. `RETRY_LIMIT_WHEN_429` is the maximum number of times `retryFetch` will retry a request when it receives a 429 response. `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT` is the default rate limit used by `throttledFetch`. `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_FETCH` is the default `fetch` function that is rate-limited and retries requests, with a rate limit of `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT` requests per second.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a convenient way to make HTTP requests to an API while handling rate limiting and retries. They can be used in the larger Oxygenium project to interact with an external API in a reliable and efficient manner. Here is an example of how `throttledFetch` might be used:\n\n```\nconst fetch = throttledFetch(5) // limit to 5 requests per second\nconst response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\nconst data = await convertHttpResponse(response)\nconsole.log(data)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains functions and constants related to making HTTP requests with rate limiting and retry functionality.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `convertHttpResponse` function?\n- The `convertHttpResponse` function takes an HTTP response object and returns its data property if there is no error, or throws an error with the detail property of the error object if there is one.\n\n3. What is the default rate limit for the `throttledFetch` function?\n- The default rate limit for the `throttledFetch` function is 3 requests per second."
