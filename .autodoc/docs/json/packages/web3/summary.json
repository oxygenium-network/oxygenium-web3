The `ExplorerApi` class is imported from another file in the same directory, along with some utility functions. The `ExplorerProvider` class provides a simplified interface for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain explorer API.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` constructor takes three optional parameters: `baseUrl`, `apiKey`, and `customFetch`. If `baseUrl` is provided, a new instance of `ExplorerApi` is created with the specified base URL, API key, and custom fetch function. If a `Provider` object is provided instead, the `ExplorerProvider` instance is created as a copy of the provided object. If an `ApiRequestHandler` function is provided, the `ExplorerProvider` instance is created with a base URL of `https://1.2.3.4:0` and all requests are forwarded to the provided handler.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` class has several properties that correspond to different endpoints of the Oxygenium blockchain explorer API, such as `blocks`, `transactions`, `addresses`, `infos`, `mempool`, `tokens`, `charts`, `contracts`, and `contractEvents`. Each of these properties is an object that contains methods for interacting with the corresponding API endpoint.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` class also has a `request` method that takes an `ApiRequestArguments` object and returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the API. This method is used internally by the other methods of the class, but can also be used directly to make custom requests to the API.\n\nFinally, the `ExplorerProvider` class has two static methods: `Proxy` and `Remote`. The `Proxy` method takes an `ExplorerProvider` instance and returns a new instance that is a copy of the original instance, but with all properties set to read-only. This can be used to prevent the original instance from being modified. The `Remote` method takes an `ApiRequestHandler` function and returns a new `ExplorerProvider` instance that forwards all requests to the provided handler.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain explorer API in a TypeScript project.

The `networkId` field indicates the network ID, which is a unique identifier for the Ethereum network. The `numZerosAtLeastInHash` field specifies the number of leading zeros required in the block hash for a block to be considered valid. \n\nThe `nodes` field is an array that contains information about the nodes in the network.

The transaction has two main stages: \"created\" and \"submitted\". \n\nIn the \"created\" stage, the transaction is unsigned and has a unique identifier represented by the \"unsignedTx\" field. Additionally, the transaction has a \"fromGroup\" and a \"toGroup\" field, which represent the source and destination groups of the transaction, respectively. These groups are used in the Oxygenium network to facilitate parallel processing of transactions and increase throughput.\n\nIn the \"submitted\" stage, the transaction has been signed and broadcasted to the network. The \"txId\" field represents the unique identifier of the transaction in this stage. Similar to the \"created\" stage, the transaction also has \"fromGroup\" and \"toGroup\" fields.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Oxygenium project to track the status of transactions. For example, a user interface could display the \"created\" stage information to the user while waiting for the transaction to be signed and submitted. Once the transaction is submitted, the user interface could update to display the \"submitted\" stage information. Additionally, this code could be used in backend systems to monitor the progress of transactions and ensure they are being processed correctly.\n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nconst transaction = {\n  \"created\": {\n    \"unsignedTx\": \"0ecd20654c2e2be708495853e8da35c664247040c00bd10b9b13\",\n    \"txId\": \"798e9e137aec7c2d59d9655b4ffa640f301f628bf7c365083bb255f6aa5f89ef\",\n    \"fromGroup\": 2,\n    \"toGroup\": 1\n  },\n  \"submitted\": {\n    \"txId\": \"503bfb16230888af4924aa8f8250d7d348b862e267d75d3147f1998050b6da69\",\n    \"fromGroup\": 2,\n    \"toGroup\": 1\n  }\n};\n\n// Display the unsigned transaction ID to the user\nconsole.log(`Unsigned transaction ID: ${transaction.created.unsignedTx}`);\n\n// Wait for the transaction to be submitted and display the transaction ID\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(`Submitted transaction ID: ${transaction.submitted.txId}`);\n}, 5000);\n``` \n\nIn this example, the unsigned transaction ID is displayed to the user immediately, and then the code waits for 5 seconds before displaying the submitted transaction ID. This simulates the delay between the \"created\" and \"submitted\" stages of a transaction.",

It consists of three main files: `index.ts`, `sign-verify.ts`, and `status.ts`.\n\n`index.ts` exports the contents of the `status` and `sign-verify` modules, making them available for use in other parts of the project. Developers can import these modules to interact with the Oxygenium network, such as signing a transaction before sending it to the network or checking the current status of a node.\n\n`sign-verify.ts` contains two functions, `transactionSign` and `transactionVerifySignature`, which are used for transaction signing and signature verification. The `transactionSign` function generates a signature for a given transaction ID and private key, while the `transactionVerifySignature` function checks if a given signature is valid for a specific transaction ID and public key. These functions can be used by other modules to handle transaction signing and verification without having to implement the logic themselves.\n\nExample usage of `transactionSign`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { transactionSign } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst privateKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst signature = transactionSign(txId, privateKey, keyType)\nconsole.log(signature)\n```\n\nExample usage of `transactionVerifySignature`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { transactionVerifySignature } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst publicKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst signature = '0xabcdef0123456789'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst isValid = transactionVerifySignature(txId, publicKey, signature, keyType)\nconsole.log(isValid)\n```\n\n`status.ts` defines a `TxStatusSubscription` class and a `subscribeToTxStatus` function for subscribing to transaction status updates in the Oxygenium blockchain network. The `TxStatusSubscription` class extends the `Subscription` class and starts polling for transaction status updates as soon as it is created. The `subscribeToTxStatus` function is a wrapper around the `TxStatusSubscription` class constructor that creates and returns a new `TxStatusSubscription` instance with the given arguments.\n\nThis code is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the `oxygenium-web3` project to build decentralized applications on the Oxygenium network. For example, a developer might use the `subscribeToTxStatus` function to monitor the status of a transaction they have submitted to the network:\n\n```javascript\nimport { subscribeToTxStatus } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst options = {\n  messageCallback: (status) => console.log('Status:', status),\n  errorCallback: (error) => console.error('Error:', error)\n}\n\nconst subscription = subscribeToTxStatus(options, txId)\n```\n\nIn this example, the developer creates a subscription to the transaction status updates for a specific transaction ID and provides callback functions for handling status updates and errors.",

The purpose of this code is to take an Ethereum address and map it to a specific group number based on the total number of groups specified. This is useful for partitioning a large set of addresses into smaller groups for more efficient processing.\n\nThe `addressToGroup` function takes two arguments: the Ethereum address as a string and the total number of groups as a number. It first decodes the address using the `bs58` library and removes the first byte. It then passes the remaining bytes to the `djb2` function, which returns a hash value. This hash value is then passed to the `xorByte` function, which performs a bitwise XOR operation on the first three bytes and the original value, and returns the result. Finally, the `toPosInt` function is called on the XOR result to ensure that the value is a positive integer. This integer is then used to calculate the group number by taking the modulus of the total number of groups.\n\nFor example, if we have 1000 Ethereum addresses and we want to partition them into 10 groups, we can use this function to map each address to a group number between 0 and 9. This can be useful for parallel processing or load balancing, as each group can be processed independently.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to map Ethereum addresses to group numbers based on a hash function and XOR operation.",

The `ALPHABET` constant is defined as a string of characters that are used in the Base58 encoding scheme. The `bs58` constant is then defined as a new instance of the `basex` function, which is initialized with the `ALPHABET` constant.\n\nThe `isBase58` function is defined to check whether a given string is a valid Base58-encoded string. It first checks if the string is empty or contains only whitespace characters, and returns `false` if it is. It then attempts to decode the string using the `bs58` constant, and encodes the decoded data using `bs58` again. If the resulting string is equal to the original input string, then the input string is a valid Base58-encoded string and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.\n\nFinally, the `bs58` constant is exported as the default export of the module. This allows other modules to import the `bs58` constant and use it for encoding and decoding data using the Base58 algorithm.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and efficient implementation of Base58 encoding and decoding, which can be used in various parts of the larger project.

The purpose of this function is to generate a hash value for a given input `Uint8Array` of bytes. The hash function uses the djb2 algorithm, which is a simple non-cryptographic hash function that is commonly used in hash tables.\n\nThe function takes in a single parameter, `bytes`, which is an array of unsigned 8-bit integers. The function iterates through each byte in the array and performs a series of bitwise operations to generate a hash value. The hash value is initialized to 5381 and then updated for each byte in the array using the following formula:\n\n```\nhash = (hash << 5) + hash + (bytes[i] & 0xff)\n```\n\nThe `<<` operator is a bitwise left shift, which shifts the bits of the `hash` value to the left by 5 positions. The `+` operator adds the original `hash` value to the shifted value. Finally, the bitwise AND operator `&` is used to mask the least significant 8 bits of the `bytes[i]` value, ensuring that only the first 8 bits are used in the calculation.\n\nOnce the function has iterated through all the bytes in the input array, it returns the resulting hash value as a 32-bit integer.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to generate hash values for various purposes, such as indexing data in a hash table or verifying the integrity of data. For example, if the project involves storing data in a hash table, this function can be used to generate a hash value for each piece of data, which can then be used to determine the index in the hash table where the data should be stored. Similarly, if the project involves verifying the integrity of data, this function can be used to generate a hash value for the original data and then compare it to the hash value of the received data to ensure that it has not been tampered with.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport djb2 from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst data = new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04])\nconst hash = djb2(data)\nconsole.log(hash) // Output: 1437863053\n```",

          "summary": "The `utils` folder in the `oxygenium-web3` project contains various utility functions and classes that are used throughout the project for tasks such as encoding and decoding data, hashing, signing and verifying data, and working with numbers and addresses. These utilities are essential for the proper functioning of the project and can be used in different parts of the project as needed.\n\nFor example, the `address.ts` file provides a function called `addressToGroup` that maps an Ethereum address to a specific group number based on the total number of groups specified. This can be useful for partitioning a large set of addresses into smaller groups for more efficient processing. The usage of this function might look like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport { addressToGroup } from 'oxygenium-web3/utils/address';\n\nconst ethAddress = '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e';\nconst numberOfGroups = 10;\nconst groupNumber = addressToGroup(ethAddress, numberOfGroups);\nconsole.log(`Group number for address ${ethAddress}: ${groupNumber}`);\n```\n\nThe `bs58.ts` file provides a library for encoding and decoding data using the Base58 algorithm, which is commonly used in cryptocurrencies. This can be used to encode and decode cryptocurrency addresses or transaction data. An example usage might be:\n\n```javascript\nimport bs58 from 'oxygenium-web3/utils/bs58';\n\nconst encodedData = '5Kd3NBUAdUnhyzenEwVLy9pBKxSwXvE9FMPyR4UKZvpe6E3AgLr';\nconst decodedData = bs58.decode(encodedData);\nconsole.log(`Decoded data: ${decodedData.toString('hex')}`);\n```\n\nThe `djb2.ts` file exports a hash function that generates a hash value for a given input `Uint8Array` of bytes using the djb2 algorithm. This can be used for indexing data in a hash table or verifying the integrity of data. Example usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport djb2 from 'oxygenium-web3/utils/djb2';\n\nconst data = new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]);\nconst hash = djb2(data);\nconsole.log(`Hash value: ${hash}`);\n```\n\nThe `number.ts` file provides utility functions for formatting and converting numbers used in the Oxygenium project. These functions can be used to ensure consistent formatting and conversion of numbers. Example usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { prettifyAttoAlphAmount } from 'oxygenium-web3/utils/number';\n\nconst rawAmount = '1000000000000000000';\nconst formattedAmount = prettifyAttoAlphAmount(rawAmount);\nconsole.log(`Formatted amount: ${formattedAmount}`);\n```\n\nIn summary, the `utils` folder contains essential utility functions and classes that are used throughout the `oxygenium-web3` project to perform various tasks such as encoding, decoding, hashing, signing, verifying, and working with numbers and addresses. These utilities can be imported and used in different parts of the project as needed.",

      "summary": "The `.autodoc/docs/json/packages/web3/src` folder contains essential modules and files for the `oxygenium-web3` project, which provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain through its web3 API. The folder consists of several TypeScript files that define constants, global settings, and utility functions, as well as subfolders containing code for handling transactions, smart contracts, tokens, and more.\n\nFor example, the `constants.ts` file defines several constants used throughout the project, such as the total number of groups in the Oxygenium network (`TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_GROUPS`) and the minimum amount of tokens that can be sent in a transaction (`DUST_AMOUNT`). These constants help ensure the proper functioning of the network and prevent spam attacks.\n\nThe `global.ts` file provides functions for setting and getting the current node and explorer providers for the Oxygenium project. By setting the current providers, other modules in the project can easily access them without having to create new instances. For example, a module that needs to make API calls to the current node provider can simply call `getCurrentNodeProvider()` to get the current provider object.\n\n```javascript\nimport { setCurrentNodeProvider, getCurrentNodeProvider } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\n// Set the current node provider\nsetCurrentNodeProvider('https://my-node.com', 'my-api-key')\n\n// Get the current node provider\nconst nodeProvider = getCurrentNodeProvider()\n\n// Use the node provider to make an API call\nconst response = await nodeProvider.makeApiCall('/my-endpoint')\n```\n\nThe `index.ts` file serves as a central point for exporting all the important modules and functions from the `oxygenium-web3` project, making them easily accessible for use in other parts of the project or in external projects that depend on `oxygenium-web3`. By importing this file, developers can easily access all the functionality they need to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain.\n\n```javascript\nimport { transaction } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst tx = await transaction.send({\n  from: '0x123...',\n  to: '0x456...',\n  value: 1000\n})\n```\n\nThe subfolders in this folder provide more specific functionality related to the Oxygenium blockchain, such as interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain explorer API (`api`), handling transactions and signing (`transaction`), working with smart contracts and events (`contract`), and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their metadata (`token`).\n\nOverall, the code in this folder and its subfolders provide a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain through its web3 API. By using these modules and functions, developers can easily build decentralized applications on the Oxygenium network, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, and manage tokens.",
