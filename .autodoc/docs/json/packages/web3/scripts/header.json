  "summary": "This code is a license file for the Oxygenium project, which is a library that is free software. The license allows users to redistribute and modify the library under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The license also states that the library is distributed without any warranty and that the user should have received a copy of the license along with the library.\n\nWhile this code does not directly contribute to the functionality of the Oxygenium project, it is an important component of the project as it ensures that the project is legally compliant and can be used by others without any legal issues. This license file is included in the project to inform users of the terms and conditions under which they can use the Oxygenium library.\n\nIn order to use the Oxygenium library, developers must first agree to the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This license allows developers to use the library in their own projects, modify the library, and distribute the library as long as they comply with the terms of the license.\n\nHere is an example of how this license file might be used in the larger Oxygenium project:\n\n```javascript\nconst Oxygenium = require('oxygenium-web3');\n\n// Use the Oxygenium library to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain\nconst oxygenium = new Oxygenium();\n\n// Display the license for the Oxygenium library\nconsole.log(oxygenium.license);\n```\n\nThis code imports the Oxygenium library using the `require` function and creates a new instance of the library. The `console.log` statement then displays the license for the Oxygenium library, which is stored in the `license` property of the library. This example demonstrates how the license file is an important component of the Oxygenium project and how it can be used to inform users of the terms and conditions under which they can use the Oxygenium library.",
