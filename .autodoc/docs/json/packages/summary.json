The CLI is a tool that allows users to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain network through a terminal interface. \n\nThe script first checks if the user has run the CLI with the correct command prefix. If not, it prints an error message and exits. If the prefix is correct, the script extracts the command arguments from the command line arguments and constructs a new command to execute. \n\nThe constructed command uses the `ts-node` package to execute a TypeScript file called `cli_internal.ts`. This file contains the actual implementation of the CLI commands. The `ts-node` package allows TypeScript files to be executed directly without the need for compilation to JavaScript. \n\nThe `execSync` function from the `child_process` module is used to execute the constructed command synchronously. The `stdio` option is set to `'inherit'` to allow the child process to use the same standard input/output streams as the parent process. The `cwd` and `env` options are set to the current working directory and environment variables of the parent process, respectively. \n\nOverall, this script serves as a bridge between the user's command-line input and the actual implementation of the Oxygenium CLI commands. It allows users to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain network through a familiar terminal interface. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nnpx @oxygenium/cli@latest version\n```\nThis command will print the version of the Oxygenium CLI.",

This directory is created in the user's home directory. \n\nThe `_downloadFullNode` function is an internal function that downloads the Oxygenium full node software from GitHub. It takes two arguments: the version tag of the software to download, and the name of the file to save the downloaded software to. It uses the `fetch` module to download the software, and saves it to the specified file using the `fs` module. \n\nThe `downloadFullNode` function is called by `startDevnet` to download the full node software if it has not already been downloaded. It takes three arguments: the version tag of the software to download, the path to the devnet directory, and the name of the file to save the downloaded software to. If the devnet directory does not exist, it is created using the `fs` module. If the specified file does not exist, `_downloadFullNode` is called to download the software. \n\nThe `launchDevnet` function is called by `startDevnet` to launch the devnet. It takes two arguments: the path to the devnet directory, and the name of the file containing the full node software. It first checks if a devnet is already running by reading the PID (process ID) from a file in the devnet directory. If a PID is found, it kills the running process. It then deletes several directories and files in the devnet directory to ensure a clean start. Finally, it launches the full node software as a child process using the `spawn` module, passing several environment variables to configure the software. The PID of the child process is saved to a file in the devnet directory. \n\nThe `testWallet`, `testWalletPwd`, and `mnemonic` constants are used to create a test wallet for use in the devnet. \n\nThe `prepareWallet`, `createWallet`, and `unlockWallet` functions are used to create and unlock the test wallet. `prepareWallet` first checks if the test wallet exists, and if it does, unlocks it. If the test wallet does not exist, `createWallet` is called to create it. `createWallet` sends an HTTP PUT request to the devnet to create the wallet, passing the test wallet name, password, and mnemonic as parameters. It then sends an HTTP POST request to set the active address of the wallet. `unlockWallet` sends an HTTP POST request to unlock the test wallet. \n\nThe `timeout` and `wait` functions are used to wait for the devnet to become live. `timeout` returns a promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds. `wait` calls `isDevnetLive` to check if the devnet is live. If it is not, it waits for one second and then calls itself recursively. If it is, it waits for one second and then returns a resolved promise. \n\nThe `startDevnet` function is the main function of the file. It takes two arguments: the version tag of the full node software to use, and the path to the configuration file to use. It first downloads the full node software and copies the configuration file to the devnet directory. It then checks if the devnet is already running by calling `isDevnetLive`. If it is, it prints an error message and exits. If it is not, it launches the devnet by calling `launchDevnet`, waits for it to become live by calling `wait`, and prepares the test wallet by calling `prepareWallet`. Finally, it prints a message indicating that the devnet is ready. \n\nOverall, this file provides a convenient way to launch and manage a local devnet for the Oxygenium blockchain, and to create and manage a test wallet for use in the devnet.

This ensures that these files are included in the distribution package and properly ignored by Git and npm. For example, in the `package.json` file, the `build` script might run `build.js`, which includes this script to copy the necessary files:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"node build.js\",\n    \"prepublishOnly\": \"npm run build\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`create-project.ts` is a script that creates a new project based on one of three templates: base, react, or Next.js. It provides a convenient way to set up a new project quickly and correctly. For example, to create a new React project, you might run:\n\n```bash\n$ oxygenium-web3 create-project react /path/to/package /path/to/project\n```\n\n`deploy.ts` defines a function called `deployAndSaveProgress` that deploys a smart contract and saves the deployment progress.

The script imports necessary modules from the Oxygenium CLI and the project's configuration file, and defines a deploy function that takes in a Deployer object and a Network object as parameters.\n\nThe Deployer object is used to deploy the contract, while the Network object provides access to the network settings. The deploy function retrieves the amount of tokens to be issued from the network settings and passes it to the TokenFaucet contract's constructor. It also sets the initial state of the contract with a symbol, name, decimals, supply, and balance. The symbol and name are converted to hexadecimal format using the `Buffer.from()` method. The decimals are set to 18n, indicating that the token has 18 decimal places. The supply and balance are both set to the issueTokenAmount retrieved from the network settings.\n\nOnce the contract is deployed, the script logs the contract ID and address to the console. The script is exported as a default function, which will be called automatically by the Oxygenium CLI deployment tool.\n\nThis script is an essential part of the Oxygenium blockchain network as it enables the distribution of tokens to users.

These files are located in the `artifacts` subfolder and can be used to create instances of the `Contract` and `Script` classes using the `Contract.fromJson` and `Script.fromJson` methods. The instances can then be converted to strings and displayed in the `Dashboard` component.\n\n```javascript\nconst contract = Contract.fromJson(contractJson);\nconst script = Script.fromJson(scriptJson);\n\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <p>Total blocks: {blocks}</p>\n    <p>Contract: {contract.toString()}</p>\n    <p>Script: {script.toString()}</p>\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\nDevelopers can use this code as a starting point for building web applications that interact with the Oxygenium blockchain. They can modify the `Dashboard` component to display additional information, such as the latest transactions or the current gas price. They can also use the `Contract` and `Script` classes to interact with smart contracts on the blockchain, such as deploying a new smart contract or calling a method on an existing smart contract.\n\nFor example, to deploy a new smart contract, developers can use the following code snippet:\n\n```javascript\nconst contractFactory = new ContractFactory(contractJson.abi, contractJson.bytecode);\nconst deployedContract = await contractFactory.deploy();\n```\n\nTo call a method on an existing smart contract, developers can use the following code snippet:\n\n```javascript\nconst contractInstance = new Contract(contractJson.abi, contractJson.bytecode, contractAddress);\nconst result = await contractInstance.methods.myMethod().call();\n```\n\nIn summary, the code in the `App.tsx` file and its subfolders provides a foundation for building web applications that interact with the Oxygenium blockchain using the `@oxygenium/web3` library.

This is because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds additional features, and Jest needs to be able to understand TypeScript syntax in order to run tests on TypeScript files.\n\nThe `testMatch` setting specifies that Jest should look for test files with a `.test.ts` extension. This is a common convention for naming test files in TypeScript projects.\n\nThe `moduleFileExtensions` setting specifies the file extensions that Jest should consider when running tests. In addition to TypeScript and JavaScript files, Jest will also consider files with `.json` and `.node` extensions.\n\nThe `collectCoverage` setting specifies that Jest should collect code coverage information during tests. Code coverage information shows which lines of code were executed during tests, and can help identify areas of code that need additional testing.\n\nThe `coverageDirectory` setting specifies where Jest should save the code coverage information. In this case, Jest will save the coverage information in a directory called `coverage` located in the root of the project.\n\nFinally, the `collectCoverageFrom` setting specifies which files Jest should collect coverage information for.

The script takes two arguments: the first argument is the version of Node.js installed on the user's machine, and the second argument is the version of the explorer backend that the user wants to use. \n\nThe script first defines a function called `extractNodeVersionFromExplorer` that takes the explorer version as an argument and returns the expected version of Node.js. This function extracts the expected Node.js version from a Scala file in the explorer-backend repository on GitHub. It does this by constructing a URL to the file based on the explorer version, fetching the file contents using the `fetch` function from the `cross-fetch` library, and then using a regular expression to extract the expected Node.js version from the file contents. \n\nThe script then defines a `main` function that reads the two arguments passed to the script, calls `extractNodeVersionFromExplorer` to get the expected Node.js version, and compares it to the actual Node.js version installed on the user's machine. If the two versions do not match, the script prints an error message to the console and exits with a non-zero status code. \n\nThis script is likely used as part of the build or deployment process for the Oxygenium blockchain explorer backend.

The `ExplorerApi` class is imported from another file in the same directory, along with some utility functions. The `ExplorerProvider` class provides a simplified interface for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain explorer API.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` constructor takes three optional parameters: `baseUrl`, `apiKey`, and `customFetch`. If `baseUrl` is provided, a new instance of `ExplorerApi` is created with the specified base URL, API key, and custom fetch function. If a `Provider` object is provided instead, the `ExplorerProvider` instance is created as a copy of the provided object. If an `ApiRequestHandler` function is provided, the `ExplorerProvider` instance is created with a base URL of `https://1.2.3.4:0` and all requests are forwarded to the provided handler.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` class has several properties that correspond to different endpoints of the Oxygenium blockchain explorer API, such as `blocks`, `transactions`, `addresses`, `infos`, `mempool`, `tokens`, `charts`, `contracts`, and `contractEvents`. Each of these properties is an object that contains methods for interacting with the corresponding API endpoint.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` class also has a `request` method that takes an `ApiRequestArguments` object and returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the API. This method is used internally by the other methods of the class, but can also be used directly to make custom requests to the API.\n\nFinally, the `ExplorerProvider` class has two static methods: `Proxy` and `Remote`. The `Proxy` method takes an `ExplorerProvider` instance and returns a new instance that is a copy of the original instance, but with all properties set to read-only. This can be used to prevent the original instance from being modified. The `Remote` method takes an `ApiRequestHandler` function and returns a new `ExplorerProvider` instance that forwards all requests to the provided handler.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain explorer API in a TypeScript project.

The transaction has two main stages: \"created\" and \"submitted\". \n\nIn the \"created\" stage, the transaction is unsigned and has a unique identifier represented by the \"unsignedTx\" field. Additionally, the transaction has a \"fromGroup\" and a \"toGroup\" field, which represent the source and destination groups of the transaction, respectively. These groups are used in the Oxygenium network to facilitate parallel processing of transactions and increase throughput.\n\nIn the \"submitted\" stage, the transaction has been signed and broadcasted to the network. The \"txId\" field represents the unique identifier of the transaction in this stage. Similar to the \"created\" stage, the transaction also has \"fromGroup\" and \"toGroup\" fields.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Oxygenium project to track the status of transactions. For example, a user interface could display the \"created\" stage information to the user while waiting for the transaction to be signed and submitted. Once the transaction is submitted, the user interface could update to display the \"submitted\" stage information. Additionally, this code could be used in backend systems to monitor the progress of transactions and ensure they are being processed correctly.\n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nconst transaction = {\n  \"created\": {\n    \"unsignedTx\": \"0ecd20654c2e2be708495853e8da35c664247040c00bd10b9b13\",\n    \"txId\": \"798e9e137aec7c2d59d9655b4ffa640f301f628bf7c365083bb255f6aa5f89ef\",\n    \"fromGroup\": 2,\n    \"toGroup\": 1\n  },\n  \"submitted\": {\n    \"txId\": \"503bfb16230888af4924aa8f8250d7d348b862e267d75d3147f1998050b6da69\",\n    \"fromGroup\": 2,\n    \"toGroup\": 1\n  }\n};\n\n// Display the unsigned transaction ID to the user\nconsole.log(`Unsigned transaction ID: ${transaction.created.unsignedTx}`);\n\n// Wait for the transaction to be submitted and display the transaction ID\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(`Submitted transaction ID: ${transaction.submitted.txId}`);\n}, 5000);\n``` \n\nIn this example, the unsigned transaction ID is displayed to the user immediately, and then the code waits for 5 seconds before displaying the submitted transaction ID. This simulates the delay between the \"created\" and \"submitted\" stages of a transaction.",

It consists of three main files: `index.ts`, `sign-verify.ts`, and `status.ts`.\n\n`index.ts` exports the contents of the `status` and `sign-verify` modules, making them available for use in other parts of the project. Developers can import these modules to interact with the Oxygenium network, such as signing a transaction before sending it to the network or checking the current status of a node.\n\n`sign-verify.ts` contains two functions, `transactionSign` and `transactionVerifySignature`, which are used for transaction signing and signature verification. The `transactionSign` function generates a signature for a given transaction ID and private key, while the `transactionVerifySignature` function checks if a given signature is valid for a specific transaction ID and public key. These functions can be used by other modules to handle transaction signing and verification without having to implement the logic themselves.\n\nExample usage of `transactionSign`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { transactionSign } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst privateKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst signature = transactionSign(txId, privateKey, keyType)\nconsole.log(signature)\n```\n\nExample usage of `transactionVerifySignature`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { transactionVerifySignature } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst publicKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst signature = '0xabcdef0123456789'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst isValid = transactionVerifySignature(txId, publicKey, signature, keyType)\nconsole.log(isValid)\n```\n\n`status.ts` defines a `TxStatusSubscription` class and a `subscribeToTxStatus` function for subscribing to transaction status updates in the Oxygenium blockchain network.

The purpose of this code is to take an Ethereum address and map it to a specific group number based on the total number of groups specified. This is useful for partitioning a large set of addresses into smaller groups for more efficient processing.\n\nThe `addressToGroup` function takes two arguments: the Ethereum address as a string and the total number of groups as a number. It first decodes the address using the `bs58` library and removes the first byte. It then passes the remaining bytes to the `djb2` function, which returns a hash value. This hash value is then passed to the `xorByte` function, which performs a bitwise XOR operation on the first three bytes and the original value, and returns the result. Finally, the `toPosInt` function is called on the XOR result to ensure that the value is a positive integer. This integer is then used to calculate the group number by taking the modulus of the total number of groups.\n\nFor example, if we have 1000 Ethereum addresses and we want to partition them into 10 groups, we can use this function to map each address to a group number between 0 and 9. This can be useful for parallel processing or load balancing, as each group can be processed independently.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to map Ethereum addresses to group numbers based on a hash function and XOR operation.",

The `ALPHABET` constant is defined as a string of characters that are used in the Base58 encoding scheme. The `bs58` constant is then defined as a new instance of the `basex` function, which is initialized with the `ALPHABET` constant.\n\nThe `isBase58` function is defined to check whether a given string is a valid Base58-encoded string. It first checks if the string is empty or contains only whitespace characters, and returns `false` if it is. It then attempts to decode the string using the `bs58` constant, and encodes the decoded data using `bs58` again. If the resulting string is equal to the original input string, then the input string is a valid Base58-encoded string and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.\n\nFinally, the `bs58` constant is exported as the default export of the module.

The purpose of this function is to generate a hash value for a given input `Uint8Array` of bytes. The hash function uses the djb2 algorithm, which is a simple non-cryptographic hash function that is commonly used in hash tables.\n\nThe function takes in a single parameter, `bytes`, which is an array of unsigned 8-bit integers. The function iterates through each byte in the array and performs a series of bitwise operations to generate a hash value. The hash value is initialized to 5381 and then updated for each byte in the array using the following formula:\n\n```\nhash = (hash << 5) + hash + (bytes[i] & 0xff)\n```\n\nThe `<<` operator is a bitwise left shift, which shifts the bits of the `hash` value to the left by 5 positions. The `+` operator adds the original `hash` value to the shifted value. Finally, the bitwise AND operator `&` is used to mask the least significant 8 bits of the `bytes[i]` value, ensuring that only the first 8 bits are used in the calculation.\n\nOnce the function has iterated through all the bytes in the input array, it returns the resulting hash value as a 32-bit integer.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to generate hash values for various purposes, such as indexing data in a hash table or verifying the integrity of data. For example, if the project involves storing data in a hash table, this function can be used to generate a hash value for each piece of data, which can then be used to determine the index in the hash table where the data should be stored. Similarly, if the project involves verifying the integrity of data, this function can be used to generate a hash value for the original data and then compare it to the hash value of the received data to ensure that it has not been tampered with.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport djb2 from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst data = new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04])\nconst hash = djb2(data)\nconsole.log(hash) // Output: 1437863053\n```",

These utilities are essential for the proper functioning of the project and can be used in different parts of the project as needed.\n\nFor example, the `address.ts` file provides a function called `addressToGroup` that maps an Ethereum address to a specific group number based on the total number of groups specified. This can be useful for partitioning a large set of addresses into smaller groups for more efficient processing. The usage of this function might look like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport { addressToGroup } from 'oxygenium-web3/utils/address';\n\nconst ethAddress = '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e';\nconst numberOfGroups = 10;\nconst groupNumber = addressToGroup(ethAddress, numberOfGroups);\nconsole.log(`Group number for address ${ethAddress}: ${groupNumber}`);\n```\n\nThe `bs58.ts` file provides a library for encoding and decoding data using the Base58 algorithm, which is commonly used in cryptocurrencies. This can be used to encode and decode cryptocurrency addresses or transaction data. An example usage might be:\n\n```javascript\nimport bs58 from 'oxygenium-web3/utils/bs58';\n\nconst encodedData = '5Kd3NBUAdUnhyzenEwVLy9pBKxSwXvE9FMPyR4UKZvpe6E3AgLr';\nconst decodedData = bs58.decode(encodedData);\nconsole.log(`Decoded data: ${decodedData.toString('hex')}`);\n```\n\nThe `djb2.ts` file exports a hash function that generates a hash value for a given input `Uint8Array` of bytes using the djb2 algorithm. This can be used for indexing data in a hash table or verifying the integrity of data. Example usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport djb2 from 'oxygenium-web3/utils/djb2';\n\nconst data = new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04]);\nconst hash = djb2(data);\nconsole.log(`Hash value: ${hash}`);\n```\n\nThe `number.ts` file provides utility functions for formatting and converting numbers used in the Oxygenium project. These functions can be used to ensure consistent formatting and conversion of numbers. Example usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { prettifyAttoAlphAmount } from 'oxygenium-web3/utils/number';\n\nconst rawAmount = '1000000000000000000';\nconst formattedAmount = prettifyAttoAlphAmount(rawAmount);\nconsole.log(`Formatted amount: ${formattedAmount}`);\n```\n\nIn summary, the `utils` folder contains essential utility functions and classes that are used throughout the `oxygenium-web3` project to perform various tasks such as encoding, decoding, hashing, signing, verifying, and working with numbers and addresses. These utilities can be imported and used in different parts of the project as needed.",

The folder consists of several TypeScript files that define constants, global settings, and utility functions, as well as subfolders containing code for handling transactions, smart contracts, tokens, and more.\n\nFor example, the `constants.ts` file defines several constants used throughout the project, such as the total number of groups in the Oxygenium network (`TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_GROUPS`) and the minimum amount of tokens that can be sent in a transaction (`DUST_AMOUNT`). These constants help ensure the proper functioning of the network and prevent spam attacks.\n\nThe `global.ts` file provides functions for setting and getting the current node and explorer providers for the Oxygenium project. By setting the current providers, other modules in the project can easily access them without having to create new instances. For example, a module that needs to make API calls to the current node provider can simply call `getCurrentNodeProvider()` to get the current provider object.\n\n```javascript\nimport { setCurrentNodeProvider, getCurrentNodeProvider } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\n// Set the current node provider\nsetCurrentNodeProvider('https://my-node.com', 'my-api-key')\n\n// Get the current node provider\nconst nodeProvider = getCurrentNodeProvider()\n\n// Use the node provider to make an API call\nconst response = await nodeProvider.makeApiCall('/my-endpoint')\n```\n\nThe `index.ts` file serves as a central point for exporting all the important modules and functions from the `oxygenium-web3` project, making them easily accessible for use in other parts of the project or in external projects that depend on `oxygenium-web3`. By importing this file, developers can easily access all the functionality they need to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain.\n\n```javascript\nimport { transaction } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst tx = await transaction.send({\n  from: '0x123...',\n  to: '0x456...',\n  value: 1000\n})\n```\n\nThe subfolders in this folder provide more specific functionality related to the Oxygenium blockchain, such as interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain explorer API (`api`), handling transactions and signing (`transaction`), working with smart contracts and events (`contract`), and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their metadata (`token`).\n\nOverall, the code in this folder and its subfolders provide a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain through its web3 API.

For example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AlertIcon } from './path/to/this/code/file';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Important Information</h1>\n      <AlertIcon />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis will render the `AlertIcon` alongside the \"Important Information\" heading in the `MyComponent` component.",
                  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of each exported component in this file?\n   **Answer:** Each exported component in this file represents an SVG icon. There are several icons such as `Scan`, `AlertIcon`, `DisconnectIcon`, `TickIcon`, `RetryIconCircle`, and `CopyToClipboardIcon`. These components can be imported and used in other parts of the project to display the respective icons.\n\n2. **Question:** How can I customize the color and size of these icons when using them in my project?\n   **Answer:** To customize the color and size of these icons, you can pass the `fill` and `width`/`height` properties as part of the `props` when using the component. For example, `<TickIcon fill=\"red\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" />` would render the TickIcon with a red color and a size of 24x24 pixels.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `fillOpacity` attribute in some of the SVG paths?\n   **Answer:** The `fillOpacity` attribute is used to control the transparency of the fill color in the SVG paths. A value of 0 means completely transparent, while a value of 1 means fully opaque. Values between 0 and 1 will result in varying levels of transparency for the fill color."

This hook takes several options, including `maxFontSize` and `minFontSize`, which specify the maximum and minimum font sizes that the component can use. The `onStart` and `onFinish` options are callbacks that are called when the font size calculation starts and finishes, respectively.\n\nThe `FitText` component renders a `div` element that wraps its child elements. The `ref` of this `div` element is set to the `textRef` variable returned by the `useFitText` hook. This allows the hook to measure the size of the text and calculate the appropriate font size. The `visibility` style of the `div` element is set to `hidden` until the font size calculation is complete, to avoid a flash of unstyled text.\n\nThe calculated font size is applied to the `fontSize` style of the `div` element.

It is designed to be used in different parts of the project with different content and actions.\n\nThe `Modal` component accepts several props, including `open`, `pages`, `pageId`, `positionInside`, `inline`, `onClose`, `onBack`, and `onInfo`. These props control the modal's visibility, content, positioning, and event handlers for closing, going back, and showing more information.\n\nThe `Page` component is used to render each page within the modal, and it handles the transition states and animations for entering and exiting the page. The `OrDivider` component is a simple styled divider with a customizable text, typically used to separate different sections or actions within the modal.\n\nThe `Modal` component uses the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the `framer-motion` library to handle animations and transitions. It also uses custom hooks like `useTransition`, `useFocusTrap`, and `usePrevious` to manage the modal's state, focus management, and previous values.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Modal` component can be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport Modal, { routes, OrDivider } from './Modal';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleModalClose = () => {\n    setModalOpen(false);\n  };\n\n  const pages = [\n    {\n      id: routes.CONNECTORS,\n      content: <div>Connectors Content</div>,\n    },\n    {\n      id: routes.PROFILE,\n      content: <div>Profile Content</div>,\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>\n      <Modal\n        open={modalOpen}\n        pages={pages}\n        pageId={routes.CONNECTORS}\n        onClose={handleModalClose}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, a button is used to open the modal, and the `handleModalClose` function is passed as the `onClose` prop to close the modal.

However, it appears to be a React-based web application that involves connecting to different connectors, profiles, and other features.\n\n2. **What are the different routes available in the `routes` object and how are they used?**\n\n   The `routes` object contains three keys: `CONNECTORS`, `PROFILE`, and `CONNECT`. These keys represent different pages or views within the application. The `Modal` component takes a `pageId` prop, which is used to determine the currently active page and render its content accordingly.\n\n3. **How does the `Modal` component handle transitions between pages?**\n\n   The `Modal` component uses the `useTransition` hook from the `react-transition-state` library to manage transitions between pages. It also uses the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the `framer-motion` library to handle animations and transitions for various elements within the component. The `contentVariants` object defines the initial, animate, and exit states for the content transitions."

It sets the display to flex, aligns items to the center, and justifies content to the start. It also sets the position to relative, height to 40px, padding to 0, line-height to 0, letter-spacing to -0.2px, font-size to 16px, and font-weight to 500. It also sets the text-align to center and applies a transition effect to color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `Container` component has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. The `primary` variant sets the `--color`, `--background`, `--box-shadow`, and `--border-radius` CSS variables to specific values. It also sets the `--hover-color`, `--hover-background`, `--hover-box-shadow`, and `--hover-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it sets the `--active-color`, `--active-background`, `--active-box-shadow`, and `--active-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is clicked. \n\nThe `secondary` variant is similar to the `primary` variant, but it sets different CSS variables for the button's color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component is a styled button that sets all CSS properties to initial values and sets the appearance to none. It also sets the user-select to none, position to relative, padding to 0, margin to 0, and background to none. It sets the border-radius to a CSS variable `--ck-border-radius`. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component has a `disabled` state that sets the pointer-events to none and opacity to 0.3. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component also has a hover state that changes the color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius of the `Container` component when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it has an active state that changes these properties when the button is clicked. \n\nThese styled components can be used to create buttons with different styles throughout the Oxygenium Web3 project. For example, a button with the `primary` variant can be used for primary actions, while a button with the `secondary` variant can be used for secondary actions. The `ThemeContainer` component can be used to wrap any content that needs to be styled as a button.",

The `Container` and `ThemeContainer` styled components from the `styles.ts` file are used to apply the appropriate theme and animation to the button.\n\nFor example, to create a primary button with a blue color scheme and a secondary button with a gray color scheme, you can use the following code:\n\n```javascript\nimport ThemedButton from './ThemedButton'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"primary\" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>\n        Click me!\n      </ThemedButton>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"secondary\" autoSize={false}>\n        Fixed width button\n      </ThemedButton>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `styles.ts` file contains two styled components, `Container` and `ThemeContainer`, which are responsible for styling the buttons.

The tooltip is positioned relative to the target element and can be customized with an offset and a delay. The component uses the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook to access the current route, theme, and mode of the Oxygenium Connect app.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses several React hooks to manage its state and layout. The `useState` hook is used to manage the `isOpen` state of the tooltip window, which is initially set to `false`. The `useMeasure` hook is used to measure the size and position of the target element and the tooltip window. The `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to update the layout of the tooltip window when the target element or the `isOpen` state changes. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `isOpen` state when the `open` prop or the `context.open` state changes.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses the `motion` component from the `framer-motion` library to animate the opening and closing of the tooltip window. The `Portal` component is used to render the tooltip window outside the current React tree, which allows it to be positioned relative to the target element even if the target element is inside a container with a `overflow: hidden` style.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component exports a default function that takes several props:\n\n- `children`: the target element that triggers the tooltip window\n- `message`: the message to display in the tooltip window\n- `open`: a boolean that controls the visibility of the tooltip window\n- `xOffset`: the horizontal offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `yOffset`: the vertical offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `delay`: the delay before the tooltip window opens, in seconds\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `Tooltip` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport Tooltip from 'oxygenium-web3/components/Tooltip'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Tooltip message=\"Hello, world!\" xOffset={10} yOffset={-10}>\n      <button>Hover me</button>\n    </Tooltip>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis will render a button that displays a tooltip window with the message \"Hello, world!\" when the user hovers over it.

                  "summary": "The `ConnectButton` folder in the `oxygenium-web3` project contains code for a React component that allows users to connect their Oxygenium wallet to a web application. The main component, `OxygeniumConnectButton`, renders a button that opens a modal for wallet connection or profile viewing. It takes several optional props, such as a label, an `onClick` function, and a `displayAccount` function.\n\nFor example, to use the `OxygeniumConnectButton` in a web application, you would import it and include it in your JSX:\n\n```javascript\nimport { OxygeniumConnectButton } from 'oxygenium-web3';\n\nconst MyApp = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to MyApp</h1>\n      <OxygeniumConnectButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThe `ConnectButtonRenderer` component is a helper component that renders the content of the modal. It takes a `displayAccount` prop to display the user's account information in the modal. This component can be used externally if a custom modal is desired.\n\nThe `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook provides access to the Oxygenium Connect context, which contains information about the user's wallet connection status and theme. The `useAccount` hook is used to access the user's account information, including their address.\n\nThe `styles.ts` file defines a styled component called `TextContainer` using the `styled-components` library. This component is a `motion.div` element imported from the `framer-motion` library, which provides animation capabilities. The `TextContainer` component is designed to be used as a container for text elements, with properties that center and align the text within the container.\n\nFor example, to use the `TextContainer` component in a web application, you would import it and include it in your JSX:\n\n```javascript\nimport { TextContainer } from 'oxygenium-web3';\n\nconst MyText = () => {\n  return (\n    <TextContainer animate={{ scale: 1.2 }} transition={{ duration: 1 }}>\n      <h1>Hello World!</h1>\n    </TextContainer>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `TextContainer` component is used to wrap an `h1` element that says \"Hello World!\". The `animate` and `transition` props are passed to the `TextContainer` component to provide animation effects.\n\nIn summary, the `ConnectButton` folder contains code for a customizable button component that allows users to connect their Oxygenium wallet to a web application. It demonstrates the use of React hooks, styled components, and the `framer-motion` library to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.",

It imports `AnimatePresence` and `motion` from the `framer-motion` library, which are used to animate the transition between different connection methods. It also imports `useState` from React, which is used to manage the state of the component.\n\nThe component takes a single prop, `connectorId`, which is a string that represents the ID of the connector to use for the connection. The `supportedConnectors` constant is imported from `./../../constants/supportedConnectors`, which is an array of objects that represent the different connectors that are supported by the Oxygenium network. The `connector` constant is set to the first object in the `supportedConnectors` array that has an `id` property that matches the `connectorId` prop.\n\nThe `hasExtensionInstalled` constant is set to the result of calling the `extensionIsInstalled` function on the `connector` object, if it exists. This function is used to check if the browser extension required for the connection method is installed.\n\nThe `useInjector` constant is set to a boolean value that determines whether to use the injector flow or the QR code flow for the connection. If the connector is not scannable or the extension is installed, the injector flow is used. If the connector ID is `desktopWallet`, the desktop wallet flow is used. Otherwise, the QR code flow is used.\n\nThe `status` state is set to the appropriate value based on the `useInjector` constant and the `connectorId` prop.

The component handles various connection states, such as connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable.\n\nThe component accepts three props: `connectorId`, `switchConnectMethod`, and `forceState`. The `connectorId` is used to identify the specific browser extension to connect with. The `switchConnectMethod` function is called when the user wants to switch to a different connection method, such as scanning a QR code. The optional `forceState` prop can be used to force the component into a specific state for testing purposes.\n\nThe component uses the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` and `useConnect` hooks to manage the connection with the Oxygenium wallet. It also uses the `supportedConnectors` constant to filter the list of supported connectors based on the provided `connectorId`.\n\nThe component renders different content based on the current connection state. For example, when the state is `connecting`, it displays a spinner animation with the logo of the selected connector. If the state is `failed` or `rejected`, it shows an error message and a retry button. If the state is `unavailable`, it suggests installing the required browser extension.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ConnectWithInjector` component:\n\n```jsx\n<ConnectWithInjector\n  connectorId=\"metamask\"\n  switchConnectMethod={switchConnectMethod}\n/>\n```\n\nThis will render the component with the MetaMask connector and handle the connection process accordingly.",

It manages various states like connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable, and updates the UI accordingly based on the current state.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `runConnect` function work and when is it called?\n   **Answer:** The `runConnect` function is responsible for initiating the connection process with the wallet connector. It checks if the extension is installed and then calls the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook. If the connection is successful, it updates the status to connected and closes the context. The function is called within a `useEffect` hook with a 600ms timeout to give the user time to see the UI before opening the extension.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle the countdown timer for the expiring state?\n   **Answer:** The code has a commented-out section for handling the countdown timer for the expiring state. It initializes the `expiryTimer` state with a default value of 9 and uses a `useEffect` hook to update the timer. However, the timer functionality is currently not being used, and the countdown timer is not displayed in the UI."

                  "summary": "The `Pages` folder in the Oxygenium web3 project contains components related to the main user interface, such as connecting wallets and displaying account information. It consists of two subfolders: `Connectors` and `Profile`.\n\nThe `Connectors` component in `index.tsx` is a crucial part of the Oxygenium Web3 project, as it enables users to connect their wallets to the Oxygenium network. It renders a list of supported wallet connectors based on the user's device type (mobile or desktop) and allows users to select the desired connector. The component imports the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook, which provides access to the current connector and route, and the `supportedConnectors` constant, which defines the various wallet connectors supported by the Oxygenium network.\n\nThe `styles.ts` file contains styled components for the user interface, including `ConnectorsContainer`, `ConnectorButton`, `MobileConnectorsContainer`, and `MobileConnectorButton`. These components are designed to display a list of available connectors to the user and initiate connections to the corresponding blockchain networks. The use of styled components allows for easy customization of the appearance of these buttons, ensuring a consistent user interface across different parts of the application.\n\nHere's an example of how these components might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ConnectorsContainer, ConnectorButton } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction ConnectorList() {\n  return (\n    <ConnectorsContainer>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Ethereum</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><EthereumIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Binance Smart Chain</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><BinanceIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Polkadot</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><PolkadotIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n    </ConnectorsContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ConnectorList` function renders a `ConnectorsContainer` component containing three `ConnectorButton` components for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot networks. Each button includes a label and an icon, and when clicked, initiates a connection to the corresponding network.\n\nThe `Profile` folder in the Oxygenium web3 project contains code related to displaying the user's account information and balance, as well as providing a way to disconnect from the Oxygenium network. The folder consists of two files: `index.tsx` and `styles.ts`.\n\n`index.tsx` defines a React functional component called `Profile` that displays the user's account information and balance. It imports several hooks and components from other files in the project, including `useOxygeniumConnectContext`, `useAccount`, `useBalance`, `AnimatePresence`, `prettifyAttoAlphAmount`, and `useConnect`. The `Profile` component retrieves the user's account and balance using the `useAccount` and `useBalance` hooks and renders the account address and balance in a modal dialog using the `ModalContent`, `ModalH1`, and `ModalBody` components. The balance is displayed using the `Balance` and `LoadingBalance` components, which use the `AnimatePresence` component to animate the transition between the two states. The `prettifyAttoAlphAmount` function is used to format the balance value. The component also renders a \"Disconnect\" button that calls the `useConnect` hook to disconnect the user from the Oxygenium network.\n\n`styles.ts` contains code related to the balance display of the Oxygenium web application. It exports three styled components: `BalanceContainer`, `Balance`, and `LoadingBalance`. `BalanceContainer` is a styled component that wraps around the `Balance` component and is used to position the balance display on the web page. `Balance` is a styled component that displays the balance of the user's account, while `LoadingBalance` is a styled component that displays a loading animation while the balance is being fetched from the server. The `PlaceholderKeyframes` constant is a keyframe animation that is used to animate the loading animation in `LoadingBalance`.\n\nHere's an example of how these components might be used in the larger Oxygenium web application:\n\n```javascript\nimport { BalanceContainer, Balance, LoadingBalance } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction AccountBalance() {\n  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null)\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchBalance()\n  }, [])\n\n  async function fetchBalance() {\n    const balance = await fetch('/api/balance')\n    setBalance(balance)\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <BalanceContainer>\n      {loading ? (\n        <LoadingBalance />\n      ) : (\n        <Balance>{balance}</Balance>\n      )}\n    </BalanceContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountBalance` component fetches the user's balance from the server and displays it using the `Balance` component. While the balance is being fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is displayed instead. The `BalanceContainer` component is used to position the balance display on the web page.",

It takes several props to configure the modal and the context it provides. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { OxygeniumConnectProvider } from 'oxygenium-web3';\n\nfunction MyApp() {\n  return (\n    <OxygeniumConnectProvider network=\"mainnet\" addressGroup=\"g1\" keyType=\"secp256k1\">\n      <AppContent />\n    </OxygeniumConnectProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `Common` folder contains reusable components and utilities for creating a consistent and maintainable user interface, such as `Alert`, `BrowserIcon`, `Button`, and `Tooltip`. These components can be easily integrated into various parts of the project.\n\nThe `ConnectButton` folder provides a customizable button component that allows users to connect their Oxygenium wallet to a web application:\n\n```javascript\nimport { OxygeniumConnectButton } from 'oxygenium-web3';\n\nconst MyApp = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to MyApp</h1>\n      <OxygeniumConnectButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThe `ConnectModal` folder contains components for connecting to the Oxygenium network using various methods, such as browser extensions, desktop wallets, and WalletConnect protocol.

The hook returns an object with `connect` and `disconnect` methods for each supported provider. \n\nThe hook uses the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook to access the current wallet connection context. It also imports the `WalletConnectProvider` from the `@oxygenium/walletconnect-provider` package and the `QRCodeModal` from the `@walletconnect/qrcode-modal` package.\n\nThe `useConnect` hook takes an options object as an argument, which is used to configure the wallet connection. The `options` object is passed to the `WalletConnectProvider.init` method when connecting to the WalletConnect provider.\n\nThe hook defines three connection methods: `connectOxygenium`, `wcConnect`, and `desktopWalletConnect`. \n\nThe `connectOxygenium` method connects to the Oxygenium wallet using the `getDefaultOxygeniumWallet` method from the `@oxygenium/get-extension-wallet` package. It then enables the wallet and sets the signer provider and account in the context.\n\nThe `wcConnect` method connects to the WalletConnect provider using the `WalletConnectProvider.init` method. It sets the `projectId`, `networkId`, and `addressGroup` options, and registers a callback for the `onDisconnected` event. When the connection is established, it sets the signer provider and account in the context.\n\nThe `desktopWalletConnect` method is similar to `wcConnect`, but instead of opening a QR code modal, it opens the Oxygenium desktop wallet using a custom URI scheme.\n\nThe hook also defines a `wcDisconnect` method that disconnects from the WalletConnect provider and clears the signer provider and account from the context. \n\nFinally, the hook returns an object with `connect` and `disconnect` methods for each supported provider. The provider is determined by the `connectorId` property in the context. If the `connectorId` is `injected`, the `connect` and `disconnect` methods for the Oxygenium wallet are returned. If the `connectorId` is `walletConnect`, the `connect` and `disconnect` methods for the WalletConnect provider are returned. If the `connectorId` is `desktopWallet`, the `connect` and `disconnect` methods for the desktop wallet are returned. \n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to connect to different wallet providers in the Oxygenium Web3 project.

It is imported from the `oxygenium-web3` project and uses the `useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState` hooks from the React library. The function takes an options object as an argument, which can include the following properties:\n\n- `logLevel`: A string that specifies the level of logging to use. The default value is `'info'`.\n- `maxFontSize`: A number that specifies the maximum font size to use. The default value is `100`.\n- `minFontSize`: A number that specifies the minimum font size to use. The default value is `20`.\n- `onFinish`: A function that is called when the font size has been adjusted to fit the text.\n- `onStart`: A function that is called when the font size adjustment process starts.\n- `resolution`: A number that specifies the resolution of the font size adjustment. The default value is `5`.\n\nThe function returns an object that contains the `fontSize` and `ref` properties. The `fontSize` property is a number that represents the font size that was used to fit the text. The `ref` property is a reference to the container element that the text is contained within.\n\nThe `useFitText` function uses a `ResizeObserver` to monitor changes to the size of the container element. When the size changes, the function recalculates the font size to fit the text. The function uses a binary search algorithm to adjust the font size until the text fits within the container. The `useIsoLayoutEffect` hook is used to suppress warnings when rendering on the server.\n\nThe `useFitText` function can be used in a larger project to dynamically adjust the font size of text to fit within a container. This can be useful for responsive design, where the size of the container may change depending on the size of the screen or the device being used. An example of how to use the `useFitText` function is shown below:\n\n```jsx\nimport useFitText from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { fontSize, ref } = useFitText()\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={ref}>\n      <p style={{ fontSize: `${fontSize}px` }}>This text will be resized to fit within the container.</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",

How does `useFitText` determine the appropriate font size for the text?\n- `useFitText` uses a binary search algorithm to adjust the font size based on whether the text overflows the container or not. It also has a `resolution` option to determine how close the font size needs to be to the ideal size before stopping the search."

                  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `FocusTrap` that can be used to trap focus within a specific element. The purpose of this component is to ensure that when a user interacts with a specific part of a web page, such as a modal dialog or a dropdown menu, they cannot accidentally tab out of that element and move focus to another part of the page. This can be especially important for users who rely on keyboard navigation to interact with web content.\n\nThe `FocusTrap` component uses a custom hook called `useFocusTrap` to manage focus trapping behavior. The `useFocusTrap` hook takes no arguments and returns a `ref` object that can be attached to a DOM element. When the `FocusTrap` component is mounted, it calls the `useFocusTrap` hook to get a `ref` to the element it should trap focus within. It then attaches an event listener to that element that listens for the `Tab` key. When the `Tab` key is pressed, the event listener checks whether the currently focused element is the first or last focusable element within the trapped element. If it is, focus is moved to the opposite end of the trapped element, effectively trapping focus within that element.\n\nThe `FocusTrap` component itself is a simple wrapper around the trapped element. It takes a single prop called `children`, which should be the content that should be trapped. When the `FocusTrap` component is mounted, it attaches the `ref` returned by `useFocusTrap` to a `div` element that wraps the `children`. This `div` element is given a `tabIndex` of `0`, which makes it focusable. When the `div` element receives focus, focus is automatically moved to the first focusable element within the trapped element.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way to ensure that users cannot accidentally tab out of a specific part of a web page. By wrapping content in a `FocusTrap` component, developers can ensure that users can only interact with that content until they explicitly close or dismiss it.",

The purpose of this hook is to determine whether a component is currently mounted or not. \n\nThe hook uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from the React library. The `useState` hook initializes a state variable called `mounted` to `false`. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `mounted` state variable to `true` when the component is mounted. The second argument to `useEffect` is an empty array, which means that the effect will only run once when the component is mounted.\n\nThe `useIsMounted` hook returns the `mounted` state variable, which will be `true` if the component is mounted and `false` otherwise. This can be useful in situations where you need to conditionally render content based on whether a component is mounted or not. For example, you might want to fetch data from an API when a component is mounted, but not when it is unmounted. You could use the `useIsMounted` hook to conditionally fetch the data only when the component is mounted.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the `useIsMounted` hook in a component:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport useIsMounted from './useIsMounted'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const isMounted = useIsMounted()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isMounted) {\n      // Fetch data from API\n    }\n  }, [isMounted])\n\n  return (\n    // Render component\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useEffect` hook will only fetch data from the API if the component is currently mounted.

This hook is part of the Oxygenium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook takes two arguments: `value` and `initial`. The `value` argument is the current value of the variable that the developer wants to track, while the `initial` argument is an optional initial value that will be returned if there is no previous value.\n\nThe hook uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks from React to store and update the previous value of the variable. The `useRef` hook creates a mutable object that persists for the lifetime of the component, while the `useEffect` hook is used to update the previous value when the `value` argument changes.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook works by comparing the current `value` argument to the previous `target` value stored in the `ref` object. If the `value` argument has changed, the hook updates the `previous` value to the previous `target` value and updates the `target` value to the new `value` argument.\n\nThis hook can be useful in scenarios where developers need to track changes to a variable and perform some action based on the previous value. For example, if a developer is building a form and wants to show an error message when a user changes a field value, they can use the `usePrevious` hook to compare the current and previous values of the field and show the error message if the values are different.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `usePrevious` hook:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport usePrevious from './usePrevious'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  const previousCount = usePrevious(count)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Current count: {count}</p>\n      <p>Previous count: {previousCount}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `usePrevious` hook is used to track changes to the `count` variable and display the current and previous values of the variable.

The hook is designed to be used in a React component and takes two parameters: the transaction ID and a callback function that will be called whenever the transaction status changes. \n\nThe hook uses the `@oxygenium/web3` library to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain. It first gets the default Oxygenium wallet using the `getDefaultOxygeniumWallet` function from the `@oxygenium/get-extension-wallet` library. If the wallet object is not initialized, an error is thrown. The `web3.setCurrentNodeProvider` function is then called to set the node provider to the one provided by the Oxygenium wallet.\n\nThe hook then creates a subscription to the transaction status using the `subscribeToTxStatus` function from the `@oxygenium/web3` library. The subscription options are defined in the `subscriptionOptions` object, which includes a polling interval of 3 seconds, a message callback function that updates the transaction status and calls the provided callback function, and an error callback function that logs any errors and unsubscribes from the subscription.\n\nThe hook returns the current transaction status as a state variable, which can be used to render the component based on the current status of the transaction. \n\nHere is an example of how the hook can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useTxStatus } from './useTxStatus'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { txStatus } = useTxStatus('0x123456789abcdef')\n\n  if (txStatus === undefined) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Transaction status: {txStatus.type}</p>\n      <p>Transaction hash: {txStatus.hash}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useTxStatus` hook is called with a transaction ID of `0x123456789abcdef`.

This allows the application to switch between light and dark modes based on user preference or system settings. \n\nThe `CustomTheme` type defines a set of options for a specific part of the Oxygenium application, called `connectKit`. This includes an optional `iconStyle` property and a `theme` property that can be either a `Theme` or `ThemeMode` object. \n\nOverall, this file provides a way to define and manage the visual styles of the Oxygenium application in a centralized and flexible way. Developers can use these types and interfaces to create and customize themes for different parts of the application, and users can switch between light and dark modes based on their preferences. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Theme, ThemeMode } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst lightTheme: Theme = {\n  font: {\n    family: 'Roboto'\n  },\n  primary: {\n    color: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n    colorSelected: 'rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8)'\n  },\n  text: {\n    primary: {\n      color: 'rgb(51, 51, 51)',\n      font: {\n        family: 'Open Sans'\n      }\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      color: 'rgb(102, 102, 102)'\n    },\n    error: 'rgb(255, 0, 0)',\n    valid: 'rgb(0, 128, 0)'\n  },\n  buttons: {\n    primary: {\n      font: {\n        family: 'Roboto'\n      },\n      color: 'white',\n      background: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      borderRadius: 4,\n      hover: {\n        background: 'rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8)'\n      }\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      color: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      background: 'white',\n      border: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      borderRadius: 4,\n      hover: {\n        background: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n        color: 'white'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst darkTheme: Theme = {\n  ...lightTheme,\n  primary: {\n    color: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n    colorSelected: 'rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8)'\n  },\n  text: {\n    ...lightTheme.text,\n    primary: {\n      ...lightTheme.text.primary,\n      color: 'white'\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      ...lightTheme.text.secondary,\n      color: 'rgb(179, 179, 179)'\n    }\n  },\n  buttons: {\n    ...lightTheme.buttons,\n    primary: {\n      ...lightTheme.buttons.primary,\n      background: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      hover: {\n        ...lightTheme.buttons.primary.hover,\n        background: 'rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8)'\n      }\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      ...lightTheme.buttons.secondary,\n      color: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      background: 'white',\n      border: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      hover: {\n        ...lightTheme.buttons.secondary.hover,\n        background: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n        color: 'white'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst themeMode: ThemeMode = {\n  preferred: 'light',\n  light: lightTheme,\n  dark: darkTheme\n}\n```",
