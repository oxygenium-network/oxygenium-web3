  "summary": "This code is a script that creates a new project based on one of three templates: base, react, or Next.js. The script is part of the oxygenium-web3 project and is written in TypeScript. \n\nThe script imports several modules, including `fs-extra`, `path`, and `child_process`. The `fs-extra` module is used to copy files and directories, while `path` is used to manipulate file paths. The `child_process` module is used to execute shell commands.\n\nThe script defines several functions that are used to prepare the project based on the selected template. The `createProject` function is the main function that is called when the script is run. It takes three arguments: the type of template to use, the root directory of the package, and the root directory of the project.\n\nThe `prepareBase`, `prepareReact`, and `prepareNextJs` functions are called based on the selected template type. These functions copy files and directories from the package to the project directory, install dependencies, and run other setup tasks. \n\nThe `copy` function is used to copy files from the package to the project directory. It takes four arguments: the root directory of the package, the root directory of the project, the directory to copy files from, and an array of file names to copy.\n\nThe script also includes license information and comments that provide additional information about the code.\n\nOverall, this script is a useful tool for quickly setting up a new project based on one of three templates. By using this script, developers can save time and ensure that their projects are set up correctly. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ oxygenium-web3 create-project react /path/to/package /path/to/project\n```",
