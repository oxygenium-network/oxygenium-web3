  "summary": "This file contains code that is used to launch and manage a local development network (devnet) for the Oxygenium blockchain. The devnet is used for testing and development purposes, and is not part of the main Oxygenium network. \n\nThe code imports several Node.js modules, including `fs`, `fs-extra`, `process`, `path`, `fetch`, `spawn`, and `os`. It also imports a function called `isDevnetLive` from another module located in the `src` directory. \n\nThe `devDir` constant is defined as the path to the directory where the devnet files will be stored. This directory is created in the user's home directory. \n\nThe `_downloadFullNode` function is an internal function that downloads the Oxygenium full node software from GitHub. It takes two arguments: the version tag of the software to download, and the name of the file to save the downloaded software to. It uses the `fetch` module to download the software, and saves it to the specified file using the `fs` module. \n\nThe `downloadFullNode` function is called by `startDevnet` to download the full node software if it has not already been downloaded. It takes three arguments: the version tag of the software to download, the path to the devnet directory, and the name of the file to save the downloaded software to. If the devnet directory does not exist, it is created using the `fs` module. If the specified file does not exist, `_downloadFullNode` is called to download the software. \n\nThe `launchDevnet` function is called by `startDevnet` to launch the devnet. It takes two arguments: the path to the devnet directory, and the name of the file containing the full node software. It first checks if a devnet is already running by reading the PID (process ID) from a file in the devnet directory. If a PID is found, it kills the running process. It then deletes several directories and files in the devnet directory to ensure a clean start. Finally, it launches the full node software as a child process using the `spawn` module, passing several environment variables to configure the software. The PID of the child process is saved to a file in the devnet directory. \n\nThe `testWallet`, `testWalletPwd`, and `mnemonic` constants are used to create a test wallet for use in the devnet. \n\nThe `prepareWallet`, `createWallet`, and `unlockWallet` functions are used to create and unlock the test wallet. `prepareWallet` first checks if the test wallet exists, and if it does, unlocks it. If the test wallet does not exist, `createWallet` is called to create it. `createWallet` sends an HTTP PUT request to the devnet to create the wallet, passing the test wallet name, password, and mnemonic as parameters. It then sends an HTTP POST request to set the active address of the wallet. `unlockWallet` sends an HTTP POST request to unlock the test wallet. \n\nThe `timeout` and `wait` functions are used to wait for the devnet to become live. `timeout` returns a promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds. `wait` calls `isDevnetLive` to check if the devnet is live. If it is not, it waits for one second and then calls itself recursively. If it is, it waits for one second and then returns a resolved promise. \n\nThe `startDevnet` function is the main function of the file. It takes two arguments: the version tag of the full node software to use, and the path to the configuration file to use. It first downloads the full node software and copies the configuration file to the devnet directory. It then checks if the devnet is already running by calling `isDevnetLive`. If it is, it prints an error message and exits. If it is not, it launches the devnet by calling `launchDevnet`, waits for it to become live by calling `wait`, and prepares the test wallet by calling `prepareWallet`. Finally, it prints a message indicating that the devnet is ready. \n\nOverall, this file provides a convenient way to launch and manage a local devnet for the Oxygenium blockchain, and to create and manage a test wallet for use in the devnet. It is likely used in conjunction with other files and modules in the Oxygenium project to facilitate testing and development of the blockchain.",
