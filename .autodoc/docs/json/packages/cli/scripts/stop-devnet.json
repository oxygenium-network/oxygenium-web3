  "summary": "This code defines a function called `stopDevnet` that is used to stop a running Oxygenium devnet. The devnet is a local development network used for testing and development purposes. The function reads a PID (process ID) from a file called `oxygenium.pid` located in the `devDir` directory. The PID is used to identify the running devnet process. If a PID is found, the function kills the process using the `process.kill` method and logs a message indicating that the devnet has been stopped. If no PID is found, an error message is logged.\n\nThis function is part of the `oxygenium-web3` project and is used to provide a convenient way to stop a running devnet. It can be called from other parts of the project or from external scripts. For example, a developer may want to stop the devnet before running a new test suite or before making changes to the devnet configuration.\n\nHere is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nconst { stopDevnet } = require('oxygenium-web3')\n\n// Stop the running devnet\nstopDevnet()\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and effective way to stop a running Oxygenium devnet, which is an important part of the development process for the `oxygenium-web3` project.",
