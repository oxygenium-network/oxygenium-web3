      "summary": "This code exports a function that overrides the default configuration of a webpack build. The purpose of this code is to provide fallback options for certain modules that may not be available in the browser environment. \n\nThe function takes in a `config` object as a parameter, which represents the default configuration for the webpack build. It first checks if there are any existing fallback options defined in the configuration. If there are, it assigns them to a `fallback` object. If not, it creates an empty `fallback` object.\n\nThe `fallback` object is then updated with three properties: `fs`, `crypto`, and `stream`. `fs` is set to `false`, indicating that the `fs` module should not be used as a fallback. `crypto` and `stream` are set to the respective browserify versions of these modules, which can be used as fallbacks in the browser environment.\n\nThe `fallback` object is then assigned back to the `config` object's `resolve.fallback` property, which ensures that these fallback options are used during the webpack build process.\n\nFinally, a new plugin is added to the `config.plugins` array using the `concat` method. This plugin is an instance of `webpack.ProvidePlugin`, which provides global variables that can be used throughout the application. In this case, it provides the `process` and `Buffer` variables, which are commonly used in Node.js but may not be available in the browser environment.\n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the oxygenium-web3 project as it ensures that the project can be built and run in the browser environment, even if certain modules are not available. It also provides global variables that can be used throughout the application, making it easier to write cross-platform code. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst webpack = require('webpack')\nconst overrideConfig = require('./overrideConfig')\n\nconst config = {\n  // default webpack configuration\n}\n\nconst newConfig = overrideConfig(config)\n\nwebpack(newConfig, (err, stats) => {\n  // handle webpack build results\n})\n```",

What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code is a webpack configuration override that sets up fallbacks for certain modules and plugins for the oxygenium-web3 project.\n\n2. What modules are being set as fallbacks and why?\n\n    The `fs` module is being set as false, indicating that it should not be used as a fallback. The `crypto` and `stream` modules are being set as fallbacks using `require.resolve` to specify their browserify equivalents.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ProvidePlugin` being used in this code?\n\n    The `ProvidePlugin` is being used to provide global variables `process` and `Buffer` to the project, using the `process/browser` and `buffer/Buffer` modules respectively."
