      "summary": "This code is a Node.js script that serves as an entry point for the Alephium command-line interface (CLI). The CLI is a tool that allows users to interact with the Alephium blockchain network through a terminal interface. \n\nThe script first checks if the user has run the CLI with the correct command prefix. If not, it prints an error message and exits. If the prefix is correct, the script extracts the command arguments from the command line arguments and constructs a new command to execute. \n\nThe constructed command uses the `ts-node` package to execute a TypeScript file called `cli_internal.ts`. This file contains the actual implementation of the CLI commands. The `ts-node` package allows TypeScript files to be executed directly without the need for compilation to JavaScript. \n\nThe `execSync` function from the `child_process` module is used to execute the constructed command synchronously. The `stdio` option is set to `'inherit'` to allow the child process to use the same standard input/output streams as the parent process. The `cwd` and `env` options are set to the current working directory and environment variables of the parent process, respectively. \n\nOverall, this script serves as a bridge between the user's command-line input and the actual implementation of the Alephium CLI commands. It allows users to interact with the Alephium blockchain network through a familiar terminal interface. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nnpx @oxygenium/cli@latest version\n```\nThis command will print the version of the Alephium CLI.",

The devnet is used for testing and development purposes, and is not part of the main Alephium network. \n\nThe code imports several Node.js modules, including `fs`, `fs-extra`, `process`, `path`, `fetch`, `spawn`, and `os`. It also imports a function called `isDevnetLive` from another module located in the `src` directory. \n\nThe `devDir` constant is defined as the path to the directory where the devnet files will be stored. This directory is created in the user's home directory. \n\nThe `_downloadFullNode` function is an internal function that downloads the Alephium full node software from GitHub. It takes two arguments: the version tag of the software to download, and the name of the file to save the downloaded software to. It uses the `fetch` module to download the software, and saves it to the specified file using the `fs` module. \n\nThe `downloadFullNode` function is called by `startDevnet` to download the full node software if it has not already been downloaded. It takes three arguments: the version tag of the software to download, the path to the devnet directory, and the name of the file to save the downloaded software to. If the devnet directory does not exist, it is created using the `fs` module. If the specified file does not exist, `_downloadFullNode` is called to download the software. \n\nThe `launchDevnet` function is called by `startDevnet` to launch the devnet. It takes two arguments: the path to the devnet directory, and the name of the file containing the full node software. It first checks if a devnet is already running by reading the PID (process ID) from a file in the devnet directory. If a PID is found, it kills the running process. It then deletes several directories and files in the devnet directory to ensure a clean start. Finally, it launches the full node software as a child process using the `spawn` module, passing several environment variables to configure the software. The PID of the child process is saved to a file in the devnet directory. \n\nThe `testWallet`, `testWalletPwd`, and `mnemonic` constants are used to create a test wallet for use in the devnet. \n\nThe `prepareWallet`, `createWallet`, and `unlockWallet` functions are used to create and unlock the test wallet. `prepareWallet` first checks if the test wallet exists, and if it does, unlocks it. If the test wallet does not exist, `createWallet` is called to create it. `createWallet` sends an HTTP PUT request to the devnet to create the wallet, passing the test wallet name, password, and mnemonic as parameters. It then sends an HTTP POST request to set the active address of the wallet. `unlockWallet` sends an HTTP POST request to unlock the test wallet. \n\nThe `timeout` and `wait` functions are used to wait for the devnet to become live. `timeout` returns a promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds. `wait` calls `isDevnetLive` to check if the devnet is live. If it is not, it waits for one second and then calls itself recursively. If it is, it waits for one second and then returns a resolved promise. \n\nThe `startDevnet` function is the main function of the file. It takes two arguments: the version tag of the full node software to use, and the path to the configuration file to use. It first downloads the full node software and copies the configuration file to the devnet directory. It then checks if the devnet is already running by calling `isDevnetLive`. If it is, it prints an error message and exits. If it is not, it launches the devnet by calling `launchDevnet`, waits for it to become live by calling `wait`, and prepares the test wallet by calling `prepareWallet`. Finally, it prints a message indicating that the devnet is ready. \n\nOverall, this file provides a convenient way to launch and manage a local devnet for the Alephium blockchain, and to create and manage a test wallet for use in the devnet.

This ensures that these files are included in the distribution package and properly ignored by Git and npm. For example, in the `package.json` file, the `build` script might run `build.js`, which includes this script to copy the necessary files:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"node build.js\",\n    \"prepublishOnly\": \"npm run build\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`create-project.ts` is a script that creates a new project based on one of three templates: base, react, or Next.js. It provides a convenient way to set up a new project quickly and correctly. For example, to create a new React project, you might run:\n\n```bash\n$ oxygenium-web3 create-project react /path/to/package /path/to/project\n```\n\n`deploy.ts` defines a function called `deployAndSaveProgress` that deploys a smart contract and saves the deployment progress. This function is likely used in the larger project to automate the deployment process of smart contracts. Here's an example of how this function might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Configuration } from '../src/types'\nimport { deployAndSaveProgress } from '../src/deployer'\nimport { NetworkId } from '@oxygenium/web3'\n\nconst configuration: Configuration = {\n  // configuration settings for deployment\n}\n\nconst networkId: NetworkId = 'mainnet'\n\ndeployAndSaveProgress(configuration, networkId)\n  .then(() => console.log('Deployment complete!'))\n  .catch(error => console.error(error))\n```\n\n`start-devnet.js` contains code to launch and manage a local Alephium devnet for testing and development purposes. It provides a convenient way to launch and manage a local devnet and create a test wallet for use in the devnet. The main function, `startDevnet`, can be called with the version tag of the full node software and the path to the configuration file:\n\n```javascript\nconst { startDevnet } = require('oxygenium-web3')\n\nstartDevnet('v1.0.0', '/path/to/config/file')\n```\n\n`stop-devnet.js` defines a function called `stopDevnet` that is used to stop a running Alephium devnet. This function can be called from other parts of the project or from external scripts to stop the devnet before running new tests or making changes to the devnet configuration:\n\n```javascript\nconst { stopDevnet } = require('oxygenium-web3')\n\n// Stop the running devnet\nstopDevnet()\n```\n\nOverall, the `cli/scripts` folder contains essential scripts that facilitate various tasks in the `oxygenium-web3` project, such as project setup, smart contract deployment, and devnet management.",

This makes it easier to write cross-platform code.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst webpack = require('webpack')\nconst overrideConfig = require('./overrideConfig')\n\nconst config = {\n  // default webpack configuration\n}\n\nconst newConfig = overrideConfig(config)\n\nwebpack(newConfig, (err, stats) => {\n  // handle webpack build results\n})\n```\n\nThe `src` folder contains the `App.tsx` file, which serves as the entry point for a React application that interacts with the Alephium blockchain using the `@oxygenium/web3` library. The application provides a simple dashboard displaying the total number of blocks on the blockchain and information about smart contracts and scripts.\n\nThe `Dashboard` component fetches and displays the total number of blocks on the Alephium blockchain using the `api.blocks.getBlocks` method. The `App` component renders the `Dashboard` component in the header of the page.\n\nThe `contractJson` and `scriptJson` variables are JSON files containing the ABI and bytecode of a smart contract and a script, respectively. These files are located in the `artifacts` subfolder and can be used to create instances of the `Contract` and `Script` classes using the `Contract.fromJson` and `Script.fromJson` methods.\n\nDevelopers can use this code as a starting point for building web applications that interact with the Alephium blockchain. They can modify the `Dashboard` component to display additional information or use the `Contract` and `Script` classes to interact with smart contracts on the blockchain.\n\nFor example, to deploy a new smart contract:\n\n```javascript\nconst contractFactory = new ContractFactory(contractJson.abi, contractJson.bytecode);\nconst deployedContract = await contractFactory.deploy();\n```\n\nTo call a method on an existing smart contract:\n\n```javascript\nconst contractInstance = new Contract(contractJson.abi, contractJson.bytecode, contractAddress);\nconst result = await contractInstance.methods.myMethod().call();\n```\n\nIn summary, the code in the `App.tsx` file and its subfolders provides a foundation for building web applications that interact with the Alephium blockchain using the `@oxygenium/web3` library. Developers can extend this code to create more complex applications that leverage the power of the Alephium blockchain and its smart contracts.",
