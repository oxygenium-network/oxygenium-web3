  "summary": "This code defines several types and interfaces that are used throughout the oxygenium-web3 project. \n\nThe `Theme` type is an enum that represents the different themes available in the project. These themes include 'auto', 'web95', 'retro', 'soft', 'midnight', 'minimal', 'rounded', and 'nouns'. \n\nThe `Mode` type is an enum that represents the different modes available in the project. These modes include 'light', 'dark', and 'auto'. \n\nThe `CustomTheme` type is currently undefined, but is intended to be defined in the future. \n\nThe `ConnectorId` type is an enum that represents the different types of connectors available in the project. These connectors include 'injected', 'walletConnect', and 'desktopWallet'. \n\nThe `Connector` interface defines the properties and methods of a connector. A connector has an `id` property that is of type `ConnectorId`. It may also have a `name` and `shortName` property, which are both of type `string`. The `logos` property is an object that contains several ReactNode properties, including `default`, `transparent`, `connectorButton`, `qrCode`, and `appIcon`. The `logoBackground` property is a string that represents the background color of the connector's logo. The `scannable` property is a boolean that indicates whether the connector is scannable. The `extensions` property is an object that contains key-value pairs of extension names and their corresponding URLs. The `appUrls` property is an object that contains key-value pairs of app names and their corresponding URLs. The `extensionIsInstalled` property is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the connector's extension is installed. The `defaultConnect` property is a function that is called when the connector is connected. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of types and interfaces that are used throughout the oxygenium-web3 project to define themes, modes, and connectors. These types and interfaces are used to ensure consistency and maintainability throughout the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file?\n- This file is part of the oxygenium project and contains type definitions for various variables related to themes and connectors.\n\n2. What are the available options for the \"Theme\" and \"Mode\" types?\n- The \"Theme\" type can be set to 'auto', 'web95', 'retro', 'soft', 'midnight', 'minimal', 'rounded', or 'nouns'. The \"Mode\" type can be set to 'light', 'dark', or 'auto'.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Connector\" type and what properties does it have?\n- The \"Connector\" type defines an object with properties related to a connector, such as its ID, name, logos, and app URLs. It also has optional properties for logo background, scannable, extensions, and default connect function."
