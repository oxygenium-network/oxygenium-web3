The `BrowserIcon` component uses a `switch` statement to select the appropriate icon based on the `currentBrowser` value. If the `currentBrowser` value is not one of the supported browsers, the component returns an empty fragment.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is a functional component that uses the `React.forwardRef` function to forward a ref to the underlying DOM element.

If `small` is true, the icon is rendered in a smaller size.\n\nThe `index.tsx` file defines a `CopyToClipboard` component that provides a way to copy a given string to the clipboard. The component takes three props: `string`, `children`, and `variant`. The `string` prop is the string that will be copied to the clipboard when the user clicks the copy icon or button. The `children` prop is the content that will be displayed alongside the copy icon or button. The `variant` prop determines whether the component should be rendered as a standalone component or a button.\n\nHere's an example of how the `CopyToClipboard` component can be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport CopyToClipboard from './path/to/CopyToClipboard'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CopyToClipboard string=\"https://example.com\" variant=\"button\">\n        Copy URL\n      </CopyToClipboard>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CopyToClipboard` component is used to create a button that copies the given URL to the clipboard when clicked. The `variant` prop is set to `\"button\"` to render the component as a button, and the `children` prop is used to display the text \"Copy URL\" alongside the copy icon.\n\nOverall, the `CopyToClipboard` component and its related files provide a flexible and reusable way to add clipboard functionality to the `oxygenium-web3` project.",

The purpose of this component is to automatically adjust the font size of its child elements to fit within the available space. This is useful for cases where the size of the text may vary depending on the user's device or screen size.\n\nThe `FitText` component uses the `useFitText` hook from the `../../../hooks/useFitText` module to calculate the appropriate font size. This hook takes several options, including `maxFontSize` and `minFontSize`, which specify the maximum and minimum font sizes that the component can use. The `onStart` and `onFinish` options are callbacks that are called when the font size calculation starts and finishes, respectively.\n\nThe `FitText` component renders a `div` element that wraps its child elements. The `ref` of this `div` element is set to the `textRef` variable returned by the `useFitText` hook. This allows the hook to measure the size of the text and calculate the appropriate font size. The `visibility` style of the `div` element is set to `hidden` until the font size calculation is complete, to avoid a flash of unstyled text.\n\nThe calculated font size is applied to the `fontSize` style of the `div` element. The `maxHeight` and `maxWidth` styles are set to `100%` to ensure that the text fits within the available space. The `display`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems` styles are set to `flex`, `center`, and `center`, respectively, to center the text horizontally and vertically within the `div` element.\n\nThe `FitText` component is exported as a `default` export, and its `displayName` property is set to `'FitText'`.

It is designed to be used in different parts of the project with different content and actions.\n\nThe `Modal` component accepts several props, including `open`, `pages`, `pageId`, `positionInside`, `inline`, `onClose`, `onBack`, and `onInfo`. These props control the modal's visibility, content, positioning, and event handlers for closing, going back, and showing more information.\n\nThe `Page` component is used to render each page within the modal, and it handles the transition states and animations for entering and exiting the page. The `OrDivider` component is a simple styled divider with a customizable text, typically used to separate different sections or actions within the modal.\n\nThe `Modal` component uses the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the `framer-motion` library to handle animations and transitions. It also uses custom hooks like `useTransition`, `useFocusTrap`, and `usePrevious` to manage the modal's state, focus management, and previous values.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Modal` component can be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport Modal, { routes, OrDivider } from './Modal';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleModalClose = () => {\n    setModalOpen(false);\n  };\n\n  const pages = [\n    {\n      id: routes.CONNECTORS,\n      content: <div>Connectors Content</div>,\n    },\n    {\n      id: routes.PROFILE,\n      content: <div>Profile Content</div>,\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>\n      <Modal\n        open={modalOpen}\n        pages={pages}\n        pageId={routes.CONNECTORS}\n        onClose={handleModalClose}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, a button is used to open the modal, and the `handleModalClose` function is passed as the `onClose` prop to close the modal.

It sets the display to flex, aligns items to the center, and justifies content to the start. It also sets the position to relative, height to 40px, padding to 0, line-height to 0, letter-spacing to -0.2px, font-size to 16px, and font-weight to 500. It also sets the text-align to center and applies a transition effect to color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `Container` component has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. The `primary` variant sets the `--color`, `--background`, `--box-shadow`, and `--border-radius` CSS variables to specific values. It also sets the `--hover-color`, `--hover-background`, `--hover-box-shadow`, and `--hover-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it sets the `--active-color`, `--active-background`, `--active-box-shadow`, and `--active-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is clicked. \n\nThe `secondary` variant is similar to the `primary` variant, but it sets different CSS variables for the button's color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component is a styled button that sets all CSS properties to initial values and sets the appearance to none. It also sets the user-select to none, position to relative, padding to 0, margin to 0, and background to none. It sets the border-radius to a CSS variable `--ck-border-radius`. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component has a `disabled` state that sets the pointer-events to none and opacity to 0.3. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component also has a hover state that changes the color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius of the `Container` component when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it has an active state that changes these properties when the button is clicked. \n\nThese styled components can be used to create buttons with different styles throughout the Oxygenium Web3 project. For example, a button with the `primary` variant can be used for primary actions, while a button with the `secondary` variant can be used for secondary actions. The `ThemeContainer` component can be used to wrap any content that needs to be styled as a button.",

It accepts several props, such as `variant`, `autoSize`, `duration`, and `style`, allowing developers to create buttons with different color schemes, animations, and custom styling.\n\nThe component utilizes the `useMeasure` hook from the `react-use-measure` library to measure the size of the button content and adjust the button width accordingly. The `Container` and `ThemeContainer` styled components from the `styles.ts` file are used to apply the appropriate theme and animation to the button.\n\nFor example, to create a primary button with a blue color scheme and a secondary button with a gray color scheme, you can use the following code:\n\n```javascript\nimport ThemedButton from './ThemedButton'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"primary\" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>\n        Click me!\n      </ThemedButton>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"secondary\" autoSize={false}>\n        Fixed width button\n      </ThemedButton>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `styles.ts` file contains two styled components, `Container` and `ThemeContainer`, which are responsible for styling the buttons.

The tooltip is positioned relative to the target element and can be customized with an offset and a delay. The component uses the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook to access the current route, theme, and mode of the Oxygenium Connect app.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses several React hooks to manage its state and layout. The `useState` hook is used to manage the `isOpen` state of the tooltip window, which is initially set to `false`. The `useMeasure` hook is used to measure the size and position of the target element and the tooltip window. The `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to update the layout of the tooltip window when the target element or the `isOpen` state changes. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `isOpen` state when the `open` prop or the `context.open` state changes.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses the `motion` component from the `framer-motion` library to animate the opening and closing of the tooltip window. The `Portal` component is used to render the tooltip window outside the current React tree, which allows it to be positioned relative to the target element even if the target element is inside a container with a `overflow: hidden` style.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component exports a default function that takes several props:\n\n- `children`: the target element that triggers the tooltip window\n- `message`: the message to display in the tooltip window\n- `open`: a boolean that controls the visibility of the tooltip window\n- `xOffset`: the horizontal offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `yOffset`: the vertical offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `delay`: the delay before the tooltip window opens, in seconds\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `Tooltip` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport Tooltip from 'oxygenium-web3/components/Tooltip'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Tooltip message=\"Hello, world!\" xOffset={10} yOffset={-10}>\n      <button>Hover me</button>\n    </Tooltip>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis will render a button that displays a tooltip window with the message \"Hello, world!\" when the user hovers over it.

What are the dependencies of this code and what do they do?\n- This code has dependencies on the `react`, `react-use-measure`, `framer-motion`, and `oxygeniumConnect` packages. `react` is the core library for building the UI, `react-use-measure` is used for measuring the size and position of elements, `framer-motion` is used for animating the tooltip, and `oxygeniumConnect` is a custom context used for managing the state of the Oxygenium wallet.\n\n3. What are the conditions under which the tooltip is displayed and how is it positioned?\n- The tooltip is displayed when the user hovers over the element or when the `open` prop is set to `true`. The tooltip is positioned relative to the element being hovered over, with an optional offset specified by the `xOffset` and `yOffset` props. The code also checks if the tooltip is out of bounds of the viewport and adjusts its position accordingly."

It has `pointer-events: none` to allow mouse events to pass through to the underlying elements. \n\nThe `TooltipContainer` component is the actual tooltip that appears when the user hovers over an element. It is an absolutely positioned element that is centered on the hovered element and has a border, padding, and background color to distinguish it from the rest of the page. It also has a shadow and a tail that points to the hovered element.

This component is a `motion.div` element imported from the `framer-motion` library, which provides animation capabilities. The `TextContainer` component is designed to be used as a container for text elements, with properties that center and align the text within the container.\n\nFor example, to use the `TextContainer` component in a web application, you would import it and include it in your JSX:\n\n```javascript\nimport { TextContainer } from 'oxygenium-web3';\n\nconst MyText = () => {\n  return (\n    <TextContainer animate={{ scale: 1.2 }} transition={{ duration: 1 }}>\n      <h1>Hello World!</h1>\n    </TextContainer>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `TextContainer` component is used to wrap an `h1` element that says \"Hello World!\". The `animate` and `transition` props are passed to the `TextContainer` component to provide animation effects.\n\nIn summary, the `ConnectButton` folder contains code for a customizable button component that allows users to connect their Oxygenium wallet to a web application. It demonstrates the use of React hooks, styled components, and the `framer-motion` library to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.",

The component handles various connection states, such as connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable.\n\nThe component accepts three props: `connectorId`, `switchConnectMethod`, and `forceState`. The `connectorId` is used to identify the specific browser extension to connect with. The `switchConnectMethod` function is called when the user wants to switch to a different connection method, such as scanning a QR code. The optional `forceState` prop can be used to force the component into a specific state for testing purposes.\n\nThe component uses the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` and `useConnect` hooks to manage the connection with the Oxygenium wallet. It also uses the `supportedConnectors` constant to filter the list of supported connectors based on the provided `connectorId`.\n\nThe component renders different content based on the current connection state. For example, when the state is `connecting`, it displays a spinner animation with the logo of the selected connector. If the state is `failed` or `rejected`, it shows an error message and a retry button.

It checks if the extension is installed and then calls the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook. If the connection is successful, it updates the status to connected and closes the context. The function is called within a `useEffect` hook with a 600ms timeout to give the user time to see the UI before opening the extension.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle the countdown timer for the expiring state?\n   **Answer:** The code has a commented-out section for handling the countdown timer for the expiring state. It initializes the `expiryTimer` state with a default value of 9 and uses a `useEffect` hook to update the timer. However, the timer functionality is currently not being used, and the countdown timer is not displayed in the UI."

If the state is `unavailable`, it suggests installing the required browser extension.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ConnectWithInjector` component:\n\n```jsx\n<ConnectWithInjector\n  connectorId=\"metamask\"\n  switchConnectMethod={switchConnectMethod}\n/>\n```\n\nThis will render the component with the MetaMask connector and handle the connection process accordingly.\n\nThe `styles.ts` file contains styled components for a loading spinner and retry button that are used in the Oxygenium web3 project. These components provide visual feedback to the user during loading and error states. The use of styled components allows for easy customization of the visual appearance of these components, making it simple to match the design of the loading spinner and retry button to the overall look and feel of the Oxygenium web3 project.\n\nThe `CircleSpinner` component, located in the `CircleSpinner` subfolder, is a crucial part of the Oxygenium Web3 project as it provides a visual indication of loading or connecting states. It is a React component that renders a circular spinner animation with an optional logo. The spinner animation is created using SVG and Framer Motion, with the `AnimatePresence` component animating the spinner in and out of the DOM.\n\nHere's an example of how the `CircleSpinner` component might be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport CircleSpinner from 'oxygenium-web3/components/CircleSpinner'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CircleSpinner connecting />\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CircleSpinner` component is used alongside a paragraph element to display a loading message. The spinner will be visible and animated when the `connecting` prop is true. This component can be easily integrated into various parts of the Oxygenium Web3 project, providing a consistent and visually appealing user interface for loading and connecting states.",

These components can be easily integrated into various parts of the project.\n\nThe `ConnectButton` folder provides a customizable button component that allows users to connect their Oxygenium wallet to a web application:\n\n```javascript\nimport { OxygeniumConnectButton } from 'oxygenium-web3';\n\nconst MyApp = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to MyApp</h1>\n      <OxygeniumConnectButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThe `ConnectModal` folder contains components for connecting to the Oxygenium network using various methods, such as browser extensions, desktop wallets, and WalletConnect protocol. These components can be used in conjunction with other components and hooks from the `oxygenium-web3` project to build more complex applications:\n\n```jsx\nimport ConnectWithWalletConnect from 'oxygenium-web3/components/ConnectModal/ConnectWithWalletConnect'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ConnectWithWalletConnect />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `Pages` folder contains components related to the main user interface, such as connecting wallets and displaying account information. The `Connectors` component enables users to connect their wallets to the Oxygenium network, while the `Profile` component displays the user's account information and balance:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ConnectorsContainer, ConnectorButton } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction ConnectorList() {\n  return (\n    <ConnectorsContainer>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Ethereum</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><EthereumIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Binance Smart Chain</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><BinanceIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Polkadot</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><PolkadotIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n    </ConnectorsContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the components in this folder provide a simple and flexible way to connect to the Oxygenium network and manage the connection state. They can be used in conjunction with other components and hooks from the `oxygenium-web3` project to build more complex applications that interact with the Oxygenium network.",

It then attaches an event listener to that element that listens for the `Tab` key. When the `Tab` key is pressed, the event listener checks whether the currently focused element is the first or last focusable element within the trapped element. If it is, focus is moved to the opposite end of the trapped element, effectively trapping focus within that element.\n\nThe `FocusTrap` component itself is a simple wrapper around the trapped element. It takes a single prop called `children`, which should be the content that should be trapped. When the `FocusTrap` component is mounted, it attaches the `ref` returned by `useFocusTrap` to a `div` element that wraps the `children`. This `div` element is given a `tabIndex` of `0`, which makes it focusable. When the `div` element receives focus, focus is automatically moved to the first focusable element within the trapped element.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way to ensure that users cannot accidentally tab out of a specific part of a web page. By wrapping content in a `FocusTrap` component, developers can ensure that users can only interact with that content until they explicitly close or dismiss it.",

          "summary": "This code defines a custom React hook called `useIsMounted`. The purpose of this hook is to determine whether a component is currently mounted or not. \n\nThe hook uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from the React library. The `useState` hook initializes a state variable called `mounted` to `false`. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `mounted` state variable to `true` when the component is mounted. The second argument to `useEffect` is an empty array, which means that the effect will only run once when the component is mounted.\n\nThe `useIsMounted` hook returns the `mounted` state variable, which will be `true` if the component is mounted and `false` otherwise. This can be useful in situations where you need to conditionally render content based on whether a component is mounted or not. For example, you might want to fetch data from an API when a component is mounted, but not when it is unmounted. You could use the `useIsMounted` hook to conditionally fetch the data only when the component is mounted.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the `useIsMounted` hook in a component:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport useIsMounted from './useIsMounted'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const isMounted = useIsMounted()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isMounted) {\n      // Fetch data from API\n    }\n  }, [isMounted])\n\n  return (\n    // Render component\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useEffect` hook will only fetch data from the API if the component is currently mounted. The `isMounted` variable is passed as a dependency to the `useEffect` hook to ensure that the effect only runs when the `isMounted` value changes.",

This hook is part of the Oxygenium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook takes two arguments: `value` and `initial`. The `value` argument is the current value of the variable that the developer wants to track, while the `initial` argument is an optional initial value that will be returned if there is no previous value.\n\nThe hook uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks from React to store and update the previous value of the variable. The `useRef` hook creates a mutable object that persists for the lifetime of the component, while the `useEffect` hook is used to update the previous value when the `value` argument changes.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook works by comparing the current `value` argument to the previous `target` value stored in the `ref` object. If the `value` argument has changed, the hook updates the `previous` value to the previous `target` value and updates the `target` value to the new `value` argument.\n\nThis hook can be useful in scenarios where developers need to track changes to a variable and perform some action based on the previous value. For example, if a developer is building a form and wants to show an error message when a user changes a field value, they can use the `usePrevious` hook to compare the current and previous values of the field and show the error message if the values are different.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `usePrevious` hook:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport usePrevious from './usePrevious'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  const previousCount = usePrevious(count)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Current count: {count}</p>\n      <p>Previous count: {previousCount}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `usePrevious` hook is used to track changes to the `count` variable and display the current and previous values of the variable. When the user clicks the \"Increment\" button, the `count` variable is updated and the `usePrevious` hook updates the `previousCount` variable to the previous value of `count`.",

The hook is designed to be used in a React component and takes two parameters: the transaction ID and a callback function that will be called whenever the transaction status changes. \n\nThe hook uses the `@oxygenium/web3` library to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain. It first gets the default Oxygenium wallet using the `getDefaultOxygeniumWallet` function from the `@oxygenium/get-extension-wallet` library. If the wallet object is not initialized, an error is thrown. The `web3.setCurrentNodeProvider` function is then called to set the node provider to the one provided by the Oxygenium wallet.\n\nThe hook then creates a subscription to the transaction status using the `subscribeToTxStatus` function from the `@oxygenium/web3` library. The subscription options are defined in the `subscriptionOptions` object, which includes a polling interval of 3 seconds, a message callback function that updates the transaction status and calls the provided callback function, and an error callback function that logs any errors and unsubscribes from the subscription.\n\nThe hook returns the current transaction status as a state variable, which can be used to render the component based on the current status of the transaction. \n\nHere is an example of how the hook can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useTxStatus } from './useTxStatus'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { txStatus } = useTxStatus('0x123456789abcdef')\n\n  if (txStatus === undefined) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Transaction status: {txStatus.type}</p>\n      <p>Transaction hash: {txStatus.hash}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useTxStatus` hook is called with a transaction ID of `0x123456789abcdef`.

This component can be used throughout the project wherever a button is needed, providing a consistent look and feel.\n\nIn summary, the `index.ts` file in the `styled` folder is a crucial part of the oxygenium-web3 project, as it exports the `styled` object from the `styled-components` library. This object allows developers to create custom styled components using a CSS-in-JS approach, ensuring a consistent appearance across the project and offering various benefits such as better encapsulation and easier theming.",

These theme files export JavaScript objects containing CSS variables, which are used to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.\n\n```javascript\nimport { web95 } from 'oxygenium-web3/styles/themes';\n\n<SomeComponent theme={web95} />;\n```\n\nIn summary, the code in the `styles` folder plays a crucial role in defining the visual style of the Oxygenium Web3 project and ensuring that it is consistent across different components. By using the CSS variables and functions defined in these files, developers can create a consistent and visually appealing UI for their users.",

These functions are primarily focused on detecting the user's browser, operating system, and device type, as well as providing helper functions for rendering React components and Ethereum addresses.\n\nFor example, the `detectBrowser` function uses the `detect-browser` library to identify the user's browser. This information can be used to optimize the application's performance or display for specific browsers. Similarly, the `detectOS` function identifies the user's operating system, which can be useful for tailoring the application's behavior or appearance to different platforms.\n\n```typescript\nconst browserName = detectBrowser();\nconst osName = detectOS();\n```\n\nThe `isIOS`, `isAndroid`, and `isMobile` functions build upon the `detectOS` function to determine if the user is on an iOS, Android, or any mobile device. This information can be used to provide a more tailored experience for mobile users, such as displaying mobile-specific UI elements or optimizing performance for touch interactions.\n\n```typescript\nif (isMobile()) {\n  // Display mobile-specific UI elements\n}\n```\n\nThe `flattenChildren` function is a useful utility for rendering nested React components. It takes a React node and flattens any nested child elements into a single array, which can simplify the process of rendering complex component hierarchies.\n\n```typescript\nconst flatChildren = flattenChildren(nestedReactNode);\n```\n\nLastly, the `truncatedAddress` function improves the readability of Ethereum addresses by truncating them to show only the first and last six characters. This can be particularly helpful when displaying addresses in limited space or when a full address is not necessary for the user's understanding.\n\n```typescript\nconst shortAddress = truncatedAddress(\"0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e\");\n// Output: \"0x742d...8f44e\"\n```\n\nIn summary, the utility functions in the `index.ts` file play a crucial role in enhancing the user experience of the Oxygenium web3 project.

These interfaces can be used by developers to create new wallet components and pass in the appropriate options and properties:\n\n```javascript\nimport { WalletOptions, WalletProps } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst walletOptions: WalletOptions = {\n  appName: 'My App',\n  shimDisconnect: true\n}\n\nconst walletProps: WalletProps = {\n  id: 'my-wallet',\n  name: 'My Wallet',\n  shortName: 'MW',\n  logos: {\n    default: <MyWalletLogo />,\n    transparent: <MyWalletLogoTransparent />,\n    connectorButton: <MyWalletConnectorButton />,\n    qrCode: <MyWalletQRCode />,\n    appIcon: <MyWalletAppIcon />,\n    mobile: <MyWalletMobileLogo />\n  },\n  logoBackground: '#FFFFFF',\n  scannable: true,\n  installed: true,\n  downloadUrls: {\n    windows: 'https://my-wallet.com/windows',\n    mac: 'https://my-wallet.com/mac',\n    linux: 'https://my-wallet.com/linux'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `connectors` subfolder contains functions that return wallet connector configurations for different types of wallets. These configurations can be used by other parts of the Oxygenium project to interact with wallets and display wallet options to the user. For example, to display a list of available wallet connectors:\n\n```javascript\nimport { walletConnect } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst walletConnectProps = walletConnect()\n// Display walletConnectProps in a list of available wallet connectors\n```\n\nOverall, the code in the `wallets` folder provides a set of functions and interfaces for interacting with different types of cryptocurrency wallets in the Oxygenium project. These functions and interfaces can be used by developers to create new wallet components, display wallet options to users, and interact with wallets for various transactions.",

  "summary": "The code in the `oxygenium-web3` project provides a set of components, hooks, and utilities for developers to easily integrate the Oxygenium blockchain into their web applications. The main component, `OxygeniumConnectProvider`, wraps the entire application and provides access to the web3 provider, allowing users to connect their wallets and interact with the Oxygenium blockchain.\n\nFor example, to use the `OxygeniumConnectProvider` and `OxygeniumConnectButton` components in a React application:\n\n```javascript\nimport { OxygeniumConnectProvider, OxygeniumConnectButton } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <OxygeniumConnectProvider>\n      <div>\n        <h1>Welcome to my Oxygenium app!</h1>\n        <OxygeniumConnectButton />\n      </div>\n    </OxygeniumConnectProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe project also includes custom hooks, such as `useAccount`, `useConnect`, `useTxStatus`, and `useBalance`, which can be used to access various information related to the user's account, connection status, transaction status, and balance. For instance, the `useAccount` hook can be used to display the connected account:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useAccount } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { account, isConnected } = useAccount()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isConnected ? (\n        <p>Connected to account {account}</p>\n      ) : (\n        <p>Not connected to any account</p>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `assets` folder contains SVG icons and logos as React components, which can be easily imported and used in other parts of the project to provide visual cues and branding. The `components` folder contains reusable components and utilities for creating a consistent and maintainable user interface, such as `Alert`, `BrowserIcon`, `Button`, and `Tooltip`.\n\nThe `constants` folder provides essential constant values and configurations that are used throughout the project, ensuring consistency and maintainability in the codebase. The `contexts` folder manages the state of the Oxygenium Connect feature in a React application, allowing users to connect their wallets to the Oxygenium network and perform transactions.\n\nThe `hooks` folder contains custom React hooks that provide various functionalities related to the Oxygenium blockchain, such as connecting to an Oxygenium wallet, retrieving account information, and subscribing to transaction status updates. The `styles` folder defines and manages the visual styles of the Oxygenium Web3 project, providing a centralized and flexible way to create and customize themes for different parts of the application.\n\nFinally, the `wallets` folder provides a set of functions and interfaces to interact with different types of cryptocurrency wallets, including three wallet connectors (`injected`, `walletConnect`, and `desktopWallet`) that can be used to interact with wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Oxygenium Desktop Wallet.\n\nOverall, the `oxygenium-web3` project offers a convenient way for developers to integrate the Oxygenium blockchain into their web applications and access various related information.",
