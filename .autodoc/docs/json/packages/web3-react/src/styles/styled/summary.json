      "summary": "This code exports a styled component from the `styled-components` library. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to create custom styled components that can be used throughout the larger project. \n\nThe `styled-components` library allows developers to create reusable UI components with custom styles using a CSS-in-JS approach. This means that styles are defined in JavaScript code rather than in separate CSS files. This approach offers several benefits, including better encapsulation, easier theming, and improved performance.\n\nThe code checks if the `styled.div` function is available, and if it is, exports the `styled` object. If the `styled.div` function is not available, it exports the `default` property of the `styled` object. This ensures that the code works with different versions of the `styled-components` library.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport styled from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  background-color: blue;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n`\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a custom `Button` component is created using the `styled` function exported by this code. The `Button` component has a blue background, white text, and rounded corners. This component can be used throughout the project wherever a button is needed, providing a consistent look and feel.",
      "questions": "1. What license is this code released under?\n- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `styled-components` library being imported?\n- The `styled-components` library is being imported to enable the use of styled components in the code.\n\n3. What does the `export default` statement do?\n- The `export default` statement exports the `styled` object as the default export of this module."
