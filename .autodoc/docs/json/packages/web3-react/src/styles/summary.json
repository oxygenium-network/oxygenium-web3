      "summary": "This code defines the default theme for the Alephium web3 project. It exports an object called `defaultTheme` which contains a `connectKit` property. The `connectKit` property is an object that contains an `options` property and a `theme` property. The `options` property is an object that contains a single property called `iconStyle` which is set to `'light'`. The `theme` property is an object that contains three properties: `preferred`, `light`, and `dark`. The `preferred` property is set to `'dark'`, indicating that the preferred theme for the project is a dark theme. The `light` and `dark` properties are both set to the same default light theme object.\n\nThe default light theme object contains properties for various UI elements such as fonts, text colors, buttons, navigation, modals, tooltips, and QR codes. Each property contains a set of values that define the appearance of the corresponding UI element. For example, the `font` property contains a `family` property that defines the font family used for text. The `text` property contains properties for primary and secondary text colors, as well as colors for error and valid states. The `buttons` property contains properties for primary and secondary button styles, including colors for text, background, and border, as well as hover states. The `navigation`, `modal`, `tooltips`, and `qrCode` properties contain similar sets of values for their respective UI elements.\n\nThe `parseTheme` function is defined but not used in this code. It takes a theme object as input and returns the same object, but with its values parsed into CSS variables.\n\nThe `userPrefersDarkMode` function checks whether the user's device is set to prefer a dark color scheme. If the function is called in a non-browser environment, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it checks whether the `window` object has a `matchMedia` method and whether the device prefers a dark color scheme. If the device does prefer a dark color scheme, the `darkMode` variable is set to `true`.\n\nOverall, this code defines the default theme for the Alephium web3 project and provides a way to check whether the user's device prefers a dark color scheme. The `defaultTheme` object can be used throughout the project to provide a consistent appearance for UI elements. The `userPrefersDarkMode` function can be used to determine whether to use a dark or light theme by default, depending on the user's device settings.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file exports a default theme object for the Alephium project's web3 library.\n\n2.

      "summary": "This file contains code that defines theme variables for a modal component used in the Alephium project. The code defines a set of global CSS variables that can be used to style the modal component. The variables are defined in the `themeGlobals` object, which contains several sub-objects that define different color schemes for the modal. The `createCssVars` and `createCssColors` functions are used to generate CSS rules based on the values in the `themeGlobals` object. \n\nThe `themes` object contains pre-defined CSS rules for different color schemes, such as `light`, `dark`, `web95`, `retro`, `soft`, `midnight`, `minimal`, `rounded`, and `nouns`. These rules are generated using the `createCssColors` function and the values in the `themeGlobals` object. \n\nThe `globals` object contains CSS rules for the brand, ENS, and graphics themes. These rules are generated using the `createCssVars` function and the values in the `themeGlobals` object. \n\nThe `ResetContainer` component is defined using the `styled` function from the `styled-components` library. This component is used to reset the default styles for HTML elements and apply the theme variables defined in this file. The component takes several props, including `$useTheme`, `$useMode`, and `$customTheme`, which can be used to customize the theme of the modal. \n\nOverall, this file provides a flexible and customizable way to define themes for the modal component used in the Alephium project. Developers can use the pre-defined color schemes or define their own custom themes by passing in values for the `$customTheme` prop.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file?\n- This file contains theme variables for a modal and creates CSS styles for different themes.\n\n2.

      "summary": "This file defines types and interfaces related to theming and styling for the Alephium project. It exports two main types: `Theme` and `ThemeMode`, as well as a `CustomTheme` type. \n\nThe `Theme` type defines a set of properties that can be used to style various parts of the Alephium application, such as fonts, colors, buttons, modals, and tooltips. Each property is optional and can be further nested to define more specific styles. For example, the `text` property can have sub-properties for `primary`, `secondary`, `error`, and `valid` text styles. The `buttons` property can have sub-properties for `primary` and `secondary` button styles. \n\nThe `ThemeMode` type defines a set of themes for both light and dark modes, as well as a preferred mode. This allows the application to switch between light and dark modes based on user preference or system settings. \n\nThe `CustomTheme` type defines a set of options for a specific part of the Alephium application, called `connectKit`. This includes an optional `iconStyle` property and a `theme` property that can be either a `Theme` or `ThemeMode` object. \n\nOverall, this file provides a way to define and manage the visual styles of the Alephium application in a centralized and flexible way. Developers can use these types and interfaces to create and customize themes for different parts of the application, and users can switch between light and dark modes based on their preferences. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Theme, ThemeMode } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst lightTheme: Theme = {\n  font: {\n    family: 'Roboto'\n  },\n  primary: {\n    color: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n    colorSelected: 'rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8)'\n  },\n  text: {\n    primary: {\n      color: 'rgb(51, 51, 51)',\n      font: {\n        family: 'Open Sans'\n      }\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      color: 'rgb(102, 102, 102)'\n    },\n    error: 'rgb(255, 0, 0)',\n    valid: 'rgb(0, 128, 0)'\n  },\n  buttons: {\n    primary: {\n      font: {\n        family: 'Roboto'\n      },\n      color: 'white',\n      background: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      borderRadius: 4,\n      hover: {\n        background: 'rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8)'\n      }\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      color: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      background: 'white',\n      border: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      borderRadius: 4,\n      hover: {\n        background: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n        color: 'white'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst darkTheme: Theme = {\n  ...lightTheme,\n  primary: {\n    color: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n    colorSelected: 'rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8)'\n  },\n  text: {\n    ...lightTheme.text,\n    primary: {\n      ...lightTheme.text.primary,\n      color: 'white'\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      ...lightTheme.text.secondary,\n      color: 'rgb(179, 179, 179)'\n    }\n  },\n  buttons: {\n    ...lightTheme.buttons,\n    primary: {\n      ...lightTheme.buttons.primary,\n      background: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      hover: {\n        ...lightTheme.buttons.primary.hover,\n        background: 'rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.8)'\n      }\n    },\n    secondary: {\n      ...lightTheme.buttons.secondary,\n      color: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      background: 'white',\n      border: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n      hover: {\n        ...lightTheme.buttons.secondary.hover,\n        background: 'rgb(0, 128, 255)',\n        color: 'white'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst themeMode: ThemeMode = {\n  preferred: 'light',\n  light: lightTheme,\n  dark: darkTheme\n}\n```",

For example, the `--ck-font-family` variable sets the font family for the entire application, while the `--ck-focus-color` variable defines the color for focused elements.\n\nSome variables are specific to certain UI components, like the primary and secondary buttons. The primary button styling is defined by variables like `--ck-primary-button-background`, `--ck-primary-button-box-shadow`, and `--ck-primary-button-border-radius`. Similarly, the secondary button styling is defined by variables like `--ck-secondary-button-color`, `--ck-secondary-button-border-radius`, and `--ck-secondary-button-box-shadow`.\n\nOther variables are related to modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and alerts. For instance, the `--ck-modal-box-shadow` variable sets the box shadow for modals, while the `--ck-tooltip-background` variable defines the background color for tooltips.\n\nHere's an example of how these variables can be used in a CSS file:\n\n```css\n.button-primary {\n  background: var(--ck-primary-button-background);\n  box-shadow: var(--ck-primary-button-box-shadow);\n  border-radius: var(--ck-primary-button-border-radius);\n}\n```\n\nBy using these custom properties, developers can easily apply consistent styling to various elements throughout the Alephium-web3 project, ensuring a cohesive user experience.",
