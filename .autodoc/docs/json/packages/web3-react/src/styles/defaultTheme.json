  "summary": "This code defines the default theme for the Oxygenium web3 project. It exports an object called `defaultTheme` which contains a `connectKit` property. The `connectKit` property is an object that contains an `options` property and a `theme` property. The `options` property is an object that contains a single property called `iconStyle` which is set to `'light'`. The `theme` property is an object that contains three properties: `preferred`, `light`, and `dark`. The `preferred` property is set to `'dark'`, indicating that the preferred theme for the project is a dark theme. The `light` and `dark` properties are both set to the same default light theme object.\n\nThe default light theme object contains properties for various UI elements such as fonts, text colors, buttons, navigation, modals, tooltips, and QR codes. Each property contains a set of values that define the appearance of the corresponding UI element. For example, the `font` property contains a `family` property that defines the font family used for text. The `text` property contains properties for primary and secondary text colors, as well as colors for error and valid states. The `buttons` property contains properties for primary and secondary button styles, including colors for text, background, and border, as well as hover states. The `navigation`, `modal`, `tooltips`, and `qrCode` properties contain similar sets of values for their respective UI elements.\n\nThe `parseTheme` function is defined but not used in this code. It takes a theme object as input and returns the same object, but with its values parsed into CSS variables.\n\nThe `userPrefersDarkMode` function checks whether the user's device is set to prefer a dark color scheme. If the function is called in a non-browser environment, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it checks whether the `window` object has a `matchMedia` method and whether the device prefers a dark color scheme. If the device does prefer a dark color scheme, the `darkMode` variable is set to `true`.\n\nOverall, this code defines the default theme for the Oxygenium web3 project and provides a way to check whether the user's device prefers a dark color scheme. The `defaultTheme` object can be used throughout the project to provide a consistent appearance for UI elements. The `userPrefersDarkMode` function can be used to determine whether to use a dark or light theme by default, depending on the user's device settings.",
