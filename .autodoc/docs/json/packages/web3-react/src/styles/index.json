  "summary": "This file contains code that defines theme variables for a modal component used in the Oxygenium project. The code defines a set of global CSS variables that can be used to style the modal component. The variables are defined in the `themeGlobals` object, which contains several sub-objects that define different color schemes for the modal. The `createCssVars` and `createCssColors` functions are used to generate CSS rules based on the values in the `themeGlobals` object. \n\nThe `themes` object contains pre-defined CSS rules for different color schemes, such as `light`, `dark`, `web95`, `retro`, `soft`, `midnight`, `minimal`, `rounded`, and `nouns`. These rules are generated using the `createCssColors` function and the values in the `themeGlobals` object. \n\nThe `globals` object contains CSS rules for the brand, ENS, and graphics themes. These rules are generated using the `createCssVars` function and the values in the `themeGlobals` object. \n\nThe `ResetContainer` component is defined using the `styled` function from the `styled-components` library. This component is used to reset the default styles for HTML elements and apply the theme variables defined in this file. The component takes several props, including `$useTheme`, `$useMode`, and `$customTheme`, which can be used to customize the theme of the modal. \n\nOverall, this file provides a flexible and customizable way to define themes for the modal component used in the Oxygenium project. Developers can use the pre-defined color schemes or define their own custom themes by passing in values for the `$customTheme` prop.",
