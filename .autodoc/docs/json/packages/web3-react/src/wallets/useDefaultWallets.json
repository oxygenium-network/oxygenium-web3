  "summary": "This code defines a function called `useDefaultWallets` that returns an array of `WalletProps` objects. The purpose of this function is to provide a default set of wallets for the Oxygenium project. \n\nThe function imports another function called `getWallets` from a file located in the same directory. This function is not defined in the code provided, but it is likely that it retrieves a list of wallets from some source, such as a database or API. The `getWallets` function takes an empty object as an argument, which suggests that it may have additional options for filtering or sorting the list of wallets.\n\nThe `useDefaultWallets` function simply calls `getWallets` with an empty object and returns the resulting array of `WalletProps` objects. It is not clear from the code what properties are included in a `WalletProps` object, but it can be assumed that they contain information about a wallet, such as its address, balance, and transaction history.\n\nThis function may be used in the larger Oxygenium project to provide a default set of wallets for testing or demonstration purposes. For example, if the project includes a user interface for managing wallets, the `useDefaultWallets` function could be used to populate the initial list of wallets displayed to the user. Alternatively, the function could be used in automated tests to ensure that certain wallets are always present and have expected properties.\n\nHere is an example of how the `useDefaultWallets` function might be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport useDefaultWallets from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction WalletList() {\n  const wallets = useDefaultWallets()\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {wallets.map(wallet => (\n        <li key={wallet.address}>\n          {wallet.address} - {wallet.balance}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useDefaultWallets` function is called to retrieve an array of wallets, which are then mapped to a list of `<li>` elements displaying the wallet address and balance. This component could be used to display a list of default wallets in a user interface.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `getWallets` function being imported from `./`?\n   - The smart developer might ask what the `getWallets` function does and what its parameters are, as it is being used in the `useDefaultWallets` function.\n\n2. What is the expected output of the `useDefaultWallets` function?\n   - The smart developer might ask what the `useDefaultWallets` function returns and how it is being used in the project.\n\n3. Are there any other functions or variables being exported from this file?\n   - The smart developer might ask if there are any other exports from this file besides the `useDefaultWallets` function, as it is the only export being explicitly defined."
