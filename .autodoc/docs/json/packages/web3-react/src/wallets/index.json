  "summary": "This code defines a function called `getWallets` that returns an array of three different wallet connectors. These connectors are used to interact with different types of cryptocurrency wallets in the Alephium project.\n\nThe first connector is called `injected` and is imported from the `./connectors/injected` file. This connector is used to interact with wallets that are injected into the browser, such as MetaMask. The `injected` function takes an empty object as an argument and returns an object with methods for interacting with the injected wallet.\n\nThe second connector is called `walletConnect` and is imported from the `./connectors/walletConnect` file. This connector is used to interact with wallets that support the WalletConnect protocol, such as Trust Wallet. The `walletConnect` function takes an empty object as an argument and returns an object with methods for interacting with the WalletConnect wallet.\n\nThe third connector is called `desktopWallet` and is imported from the `./connectors/desktopWallet` file. This connector is used to interact with wallets that are installed on the user's desktop, such as Alephium Desktop Wallet. The `desktopWallet` function takes an empty object as an argument and returns an object with methods for interacting with the desktop wallet.\n\nThe `getWallets` function takes an optional object as an argument with two properties: `appName` and `shimDisconnect`. These properties are not used in the function and are therefore left empty. The function then returns an array of the three wallet connectors, which can be used in other parts of the Alephium project to interact with different types of wallets.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { getWallets } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst wallets = getWallets({})\nconsole.log(wallets) // [injected({}), walletConnect({}), desktopWallet()]\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is part of the Alephium project and contains a function that returns an array of wallet connectors.\n\n2. What are the available wallet connectors in this code?\n- The available wallet connectors in this code are `injected`, `walletConnect`, and `desktopWallet`.\n\n3. Are there any parameters that can be passed to the `getWallets` function?\n- Yes, the `getWallets` function takes an object as its parameter with optional properties `appName` and `shimDisconnect`."
