      "summary": "This code defines a function called `desktopWallet` that returns a `WalletProps` object. The purpose of this function is to provide a connector configuration for the desktop wallet. \n\nThe function first imports `WalletProps` from the `../wallet` file and `supportedConnectors` from the `../../constants/supportedConnectors` file. `WalletProps` is likely an interface or type that defines the properties of a wallet object, while `supportedConnectors` is an array of objects that represent different wallet connectors. \n\nThe `desktopWallet` function then searches through the `supportedConnectors` array to find the connector with an `id` of `'desktopWallet'`. If it cannot find this connector, it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns the `desktopWalletConnector` object as a `WalletProps` object. \n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to provide a standardized way of accessing the desktop wallet connector configuration. Other parts of the project can import this function and use it to retrieve the necessary configuration information for the desktop wallet. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { desktopWallet } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst walletConfig = desktopWallet()\nconsole.log(walletConfig) // outputs the desktop wallet connector configuration as a WalletProps object\n```",

      "summary": "This code defines a function called `injected` that returns an object with properties related to a wallet. The purpose of this code is to provide information about a wallet that is injected into a web3 provider. \n\nThe function takes an argument called `_walletOptions`, but it is not used in the function. Instead, the function first checks if the `window` object is defined, which indicates that the wallet is installed as a browser extension. If the `window` object is not defined, the function checks if the user is on a mobile device and if the wallet is not installed. If both conditions are true, the function sets a flag to indicate that the wallet should use WalletConnect, which is a protocol for connecting wallets to decentralized applications. \n\nThe function then returns an object with the following properties:\n- `id`: a string that identifies the wallet as \"injected\"\n- `name`: a string that describes the name of the wallet as \"Extension Wallet\"\n- `shortName`: a string that provides a shorter name for the wallet as \"browser\"\n- `scannable`: a boolean that indicates whether the wallet can be scanned (presumably by a QR code)\n- `logos`: an object that contains a default logo for the wallet, which is an Oxygenium icon\n- `installed`: a boolean that indicates whether the wallet is installed. If the `shouldUseWalletConnect` flag is true, this property is set to false, otherwise it is set to true if the `window` object is defined. \n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project that interacts with a web3 provider and needs to detect the presence of a wallet. The `injected` function provides information about the wallet that can be used to display wallet options to the user or to determine which wallet to use for a particular transaction. For example, the `logos` property could be used to display the Oxygenium icon next to the wallet name. The `installed` property could be used to determine whether to display a message to the user to install the wallet. Overall, this code provides a simple way to detect the presence of a wallet and provide information about it to the user.",

      "summary": "This code defines a function called `walletConnect` that returns an object with properties representing a wallet connector. The purpose of this code is to provide a way for users to connect their wallets to the Oxygenium network. \n\nThe function takes in an object called `_walletOptions` as an argument, but this argument is not used in the function. Instead, the function returns an object with the following properties:\n\n- `id`: A string representing the ID of the wallet connector. In this case, it is set to `'walletConnect'`.\n- `name`: A string representing the name of the wallet connector. In this case, it is set to `'Other Wallets'`.\n- `logos`: An object with properties representing different logos for the wallet connector. The logos are imported from a file called `Logos` located in the `assets` directory. There are five different logos: `default`, `mobile`, `transparent`, `connectorButton`, and `qrCode`. Each logo is a React component that renders an SVG image. The `background` prop is used to determine whether the logo should have a background color or not.\n- `logoBackground`: A string representing the background color of the logo. In this case, it is set to `'var(--ck-brand-walletConnect)'`.\n- `scannable`: A boolean representing whether the wallet connector can be scanned. In this case, it is set to `true`.\n\nThis code is used in the larger Oxygenium project to provide a standardized way for users to connect their wallets to the network. By defining a set of properties for each wallet connector, the project can ensure that each connector has a consistent look and feel. Other files in the project can import this function and use it to display a list of available wallet connectors to the user.

The definition of this type is not shown in this code snippet.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `Logos` import and how is it used in this code?\n   The `Logos` import is used to access different logos related to the wallet integration. These logos are then assigned to the `logos` property of the object returned by the `walletConnect` function."
