  "summary": "This code defines a function called `desktopWallet` that returns a `WalletProps` object. The purpose of this function is to provide a connector configuration for the desktop wallet. \n\nThe function first imports `WalletProps` from the `../wallet` file and `supportedConnectors` from the `../../constants/supportedConnectors` file. `WalletProps` is likely an interface or type that defines the properties of a wallet object, while `supportedConnectors` is an array of objects that represent different wallet connectors. \n\nThe `desktopWallet` function then searches through the `supportedConnectors` array to find the connector with an `id` of `'desktopWallet'`. If it cannot find this connector, it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns the `desktopWalletConnector` object as a `WalletProps` object. \n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to provide a standardized way of accessing the desktop wallet connector configuration. Other parts of the project can import this function and use it to retrieve the necessary configuration information for the desktop wallet. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { desktopWallet } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst walletConfig = desktopWallet()\nconsole.log(walletConfig) // outputs the desktop wallet connector configuration as a WalletProps object\n```",
