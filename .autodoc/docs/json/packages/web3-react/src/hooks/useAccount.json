  "summary": "This file contains a custom React hook called `useAccount` that is used to connect to an Oxygenium wallet and retrieve the current account. The hook is designed to be used in a React component and takes an optional callback function `onDisconnected` that is called when the wallet is disconnected.\n\nThe hook uses the `useEffect` hook to perform the connection to the wallet when the component is mounted. It first retrieves the `context` object from the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook, which contains information about the current network, address group, and key type. It then checks if the current connector is either WalletConnect or Desktop Wallet, and if so, it returns without doing anything.\n\nIf the current connector is not WalletConnect or Desktop Wallet, the hook retrieves the default Oxygenium wallet using the `getDefaultOxygeniumWallet` function from the `@oxygenium/get-extension-wallet` library. It then checks if the current account is already connected and matches the current network, address group, and key type. If so, it returns without doing anything.\n\nIf the current account is not connected or does not match the current network, address group, and key type, the hook calls the `enableIfConnected` function on the Oxygenium wallet to connect to the wallet and enable the account. It passes in the `onDisconnected` callback function if it was provided, as well as the current network, address group, and key type. If the account is successfully enabled, the hook sets the signer provider and account in the `context` object.\n\nFinally, the hook returns an object containing the current account and a boolean indicating whether the account is connected or not.\n\nThis hook can be used in a React component to retrieve the current account and connect to an Oxygenium wallet. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useAccount } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { account, isConnected } = useAccount()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isConnected ? (\n        <p>Connected to account {account}</p>\n      ) : (\n        <p>Not connected to any account</p>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
