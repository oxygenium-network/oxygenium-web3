  "summary": "This code defines a custom React hook called `useBalance` that allows a user to retrieve their balance for the Oxygenium cryptocurrency. The hook is part of the Oxygenium Web3 project, which is a library for interacting with the Oxygenium blockchain.\n\nThe hook uses the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from React to manage state and side effects. It also imports the `Balance` type from the Oxygenium Web3 library and the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook from a custom context called `oxygeniumConnect`.\n\nWhen the `useBalance` hook is called, it retrieves the `context` object from the `oxygeniumConnect` context. This context contains information about the user's account and the node provider they are connected to. If this information is available, the hook retrieves the user's balance from the node provider using the `addresses.getAddressesAddressBalance` method. The balance is then stored in the `balance` state variable using the `setBalance` function.\n\nThe hook returns an object containing the user's balance. This object can be used in a React component to display the user's balance on the screen.\n\nHere is an example of how the `useBalance` hook can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useBalance } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction Balance() {\n  const { balance } = useBalance()\n\n  if (!balance) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  return <div>Your balance is {balance.toString()}</div>\n}\n```\n\nThis component uses the `useBalance` hook to retrieve the user's balance and display it on the screen. If the balance is not available yet, it displays a loading message.",
