  "summary": "This code file contains a collection of SVG icons that are used in the Alephium-web3 project. These icons are defined as React functional components, which can be easily imported and used in other parts of the project. The icons included in this file are:\n\n1. `Scan`: A generic scan icon, which can be used to represent scanning or searching functionality.\n2. `AlertIcon`: An alert icon, typically used to indicate warnings or important information.\n3. `DisconnectIcon`: A disconnect icon, which can be used to represent disconnection from a network or service.\n4. `TickIcon`: A tick icon, often used to indicate success or completion of a task.\n5. `RetryIconCircle`: A circular retry icon, which can be used to represent retrying an action or refreshing data.\n6. `CopyToClipboardIcon`: An icon representing the action of copying content to the clipboard.\n\nEach icon component accepts a set of props, which can be used to customize the appearance and behavior of the icon. For example, you can change the size, color, or other attributes of the icon by passing the appropriate props.\n\nTo use one of these icons in your project, you can import the desired icon component and include it in your JSX code. For example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AlertIcon } from './path/to/this/code/file';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Important Information</h1>\n      <AlertIcon />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis will render the `AlertIcon` alongside the \"Important Information\" heading in the `MyComponent` component.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of each exported component in this file?\n   **Answer:** Each exported component in this file represents an SVG icon. There are several icons such as `Scan`, `AlertIcon`, `DisconnectIcon`, `TickIcon`, `RetryIconCircle`, and `CopyToClipboardIcon`. These components can be imported and used in other parts of the project to display the respective icons.\n\n2. **Question:** How can I customize the color and size of these icons when using them in my project?\n   **Answer:** To customize the color and size of these icons, you can pass the `fill` and `width`/`height` properties as part of the `props` when using the component. For example, `<TickIcon fill=\"red\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" />` would render the TickIcon with a red color and a size of 24x24 pixels.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `fillOpacity` attribute in some of the SVG paths?\n   **Answer:** The `fillOpacity` attribute is used to control the transparency of the fill color in the SVG paths. A value of 0 means completely transparent, while a value of 1 means fully opaque. Values between 0 and 1 will result in varying levels of transparency for the fill color."
