  "summary": "The `ConnectModal` component is a React functional component that renders a modal window for connecting to the Alephium network. It imports several other components and hooks from the `oxygenium-web3` project, including `useEffect`, `useAlephiumConnectContext`, `Modal`, `Connectors`, `ConnectUsing`, `Profile`, and `useAccount`.\n\nThe `ConnectModal` component takes three optional props: `mode`, `theme`, and `customTheme`. These props are used to set the mode and theme of the modal window, as well as any custom theme properties that may be passed in.\n\nThe `ConnectModal` component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook to get the current state of the Alephium network connection. It also uses the `useAccount` hook to get the current account information. Based on this information, the component sets the `closeable` prop to `true` and determines whether to show a back button in the modal window.\n\nThe `ConnectModal` component defines an array of `Page` objects that represent the different pages of the modal window. These pages include the `Connectors` page, the `Connect` page, and the `Profile` page. Each page is associated with an `id` and a `content` property that contains the JSX to render the page.\n\nThe `ConnectModal` component defines several `useEffect` hooks that are used to update the state of the Alephium network connection, the mode and theme of the modal window, and the custom theme properties. These hooks are called whenever the corresponding prop or state value changes.\n\nFinally, the `ConnectModal` component returns a `Modal` component that renders the modal window. The `Modal` component takes several props, including the `open` prop that determines whether the modal window is visible, the `pages` prop that contains the array of `Page` objects, the `pageId` prop that determines which page to show, the `onClose` prop that is called when the modal window is closed, the `onInfo` prop that is called when the info button is clicked, and the `onBack` prop that is called when the back button is clicked.\n\nOverall, the `ConnectModal` component provides a simple and flexible way to connect to the Alephium network and manage the connection state. It can be used in conjunction with other components and hooks from the `oxygenium-web3` project to build more complex applications that interact with the Alephium network.",
