      "summary": "The `ConnectWithInjector` component in the `oxygenium-web3` project is responsible for managing the connection between the Oxygenium wallet and supported browser extensions (also known as injectors). The component handles various connection states, such as connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable.\n\nThe component accepts three props: `connectorId`, `switchConnectMethod`, and `forceState`. The `connectorId` is used to identify the specific browser extension to connect with. The `switchConnectMethod` function is called when the user wants to switch to a different connection method, such as scanning a QR code. The optional `forceState` prop can be used to force the component into a specific state for testing purposes.\n\nThe component uses the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` and `useConnect` hooks to manage the connection with the Oxygenium wallet. It also uses the `supportedConnectors` constant to filter the list of supported connectors based on the provided `connectorId`.\n\nThe component renders different content based on the current connection state. For example, when the state is `connecting`, it displays a spinner animation with the logo of the selected connector. If the state is `failed` or `rejected`, it shows an error message and a retry button. If the state is `unavailable`, it suggests installing the required browser extension.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ConnectWithInjector` component:\n\n```jsx\n<ConnectWithInjector\n  connectorId=\"metamask\"\n  switchConnectMethod={switchConnectMethod}\n/>\n```\n\nThis will render the component with the MetaMask connector and handle the connection process accordingly.",
      "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ConnectWithInjector` component and how does it work with different connector states?\n   **Answer:** The `ConnectWithInjector` component is responsible for handling the connection process with different wallet connectors. It manages various states like connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable, and updates the UI accordingly based on the current state.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `runConnect` function work and when is it called?\n   **Answer:** The `runConnect` function is responsible for initiating the connection process with the wallet connector. It checks if the extension is installed and then calls the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook. If the connection is successful, it updates the status to connected and closes the context. The function is called within a `useEffect` hook with a 600ms timeout to give the user time to see the UI before opening the extension.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle the countdown timer for the expiring state?\n   **Answer:** The code has a commented-out section for handling the countdown timer for the expiring state. It initializes the `expiryTimer` state with a default value of 9 and uses a `useEffect` hook to update the timer. However, the timer functionality is currently not being used, and the countdown timer is not displayed in the UI."

      "summary": "This file contains styled components for a loading spinner and retry button that are used in the Oxygenium web3 project. The `Content` component is a container for the modal content and has a flexbox layout with a vertical column direction and a gap of 6px between its child elements. It also has a relative position and spans the full width of its parent container. The `Container` component is a container for the loading spinner and has a motion animation applied to it. The `ConnectingContainer` component is a container for the loading spinner and has a fixed height of 120px and is centered horizontally and vertically within its parent container. The `ConnectingAnimation` component is the actual loading spinner and has two animation keyframes applied to it: `shakeKeyframes` and `outlineKeyframes`. The `shakeKeyframes` animation causes the spinner to shake back and forth horizontally, while the `outlineKeyframes` animation causes a red outline to appear around the spinner and then fade out. The `RetryButton` component is a button that appears when there is an error and allows the user to retry the action. It has a fixed position in the bottom right corner of its parent container and has a circular shape with a 32px diameter. The `RetryIconContainer` component is a container for the retry button icon and has a conic gradient applied to it. \n\nThese components are used throughout the Oxygenium web3 project to provide visual feedback to the user during loading and error states. For example, the `ConnectingContainer` component may be used when the user is waiting for a transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain, while the `RetryButton` component may be used when there is an error fetching data from a remote server. The use of styled components allows for easy customization of the visual appearance of these components, making it simple to match the design of the loading spinner and retry button to the overall look and feel of the Oxygenium web3 project.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains styled components for a connecting animation and retry button for a modal.\n\n2.

What is the purpose of the `ConnectingAnimation` component's props `$shake` and `$circle`?\n- The `$shake` prop is used to trigger a shaking animation for the connecting animation, while the `$circle` prop is used to change the shape of the animation from a square to a circle."

          "summary": "The `CircleSpinner` component is a React component that renders a circular spinner animation with an optional logo. It is used to indicate that a process is running or loading, such as when connecting to a server or fetching data. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `logo`, `smallLogo`, `connecting`, `unavailable`, and `countdown`. The `logo` prop is used to pass in a custom logo to be displayed in the center of the spinner. The `smallLogo` prop is a boolean that determines whether the logo should be smaller. The `connecting` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should be displayed. The `unavailable` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should have a rounded border or not. The `countdown` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should have a countdown animation.\n\nThe spinner animation is created using SVG and Framer Motion. The spinner consists of a circular path that is animated to rotate around the center of the spinner. The `AnimatePresence` component is used to animate the spinner in and out of the DOM. When the `connecting` prop is true, the spinner is displayed with a fade-in animation. When the `countdown` prop is true, the spinner is displayed with a countdown animation that fades out after a short duration.\n\nThe `CircleSpinner` component is used throughout the Oxygenium Web3 project to indicate loading or connecting states. It can be used in conjunction with other components to create a more complex loading or connecting UI. For example, it can be used in a modal or overlay to indicate that a process is running in the background. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport CircleSpinner from 'oxygenium-web3/components/CircleSpinner'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CircleSpinner connecting />\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
