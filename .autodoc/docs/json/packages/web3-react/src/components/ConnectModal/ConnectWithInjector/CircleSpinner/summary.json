      "summary": "The `CircleSpinner` component is a React component that renders a circular spinner animation with an optional logo. It is used to indicate that a process is running or loading, such as when connecting to a server or fetching data. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `logo`, `smallLogo`, `connecting`, `unavailable`, and `countdown`. The `logo` prop is used to pass in a custom logo to be displayed in the center of the spinner. The `smallLogo` prop is a boolean that determines whether the logo should be smaller. The `connecting` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should be displayed. The `unavailable` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should have a rounded border or not. The `countdown` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should have a countdown animation.\n\nThe spinner animation is created using SVG and Framer Motion. The spinner consists of a circular path that is animated to rotate around the center of the spinner. The `AnimatePresence` component is used to animate the spinner in and out of the DOM. When the `connecting` prop is true, the spinner is displayed with a fade-in animation. When the `countdown` prop is true, the spinner is displayed with a countdown animation that fades out after a short duration.\n\nThe `CircleSpinner` component is used throughout the Oxygenium Web3 project to indicate loading or connecting states. It can be used in conjunction with other components to create a more complex loading or connecting UI. For example, it can be used in a modal or overlay to indicate that a process is running in the background. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport CircleSpinner from 'oxygenium-web3/components/CircleSpinner'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CircleSpinner connecting />\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",

      "summary": "This file contains styled components for the Oxygenium web3 project. The purpose of this code is to define the styles for the logo and spinner components used in the project. \n\nThe LogoContainer component is a container for the logo and spinner components. It is a motion div with a fixed width and height, and a z-index of 4. The Logo component is a motion div that is positioned absolutely within the LogoContainer. It has a border-radius of 50px, a background color of var(--ck-body-background), and is centered within the LogoContainer. The SpinnerContainer component is also a motion div that is positioned absolutely within the LogoContainer. The ExpiringSpinner and Spinner components are both motion divs that are positioned absolutely within the SpinnerContainer. \n\nThe ExpiringSpinner component is a spinner that has two halves that rotate in opposite directions. It is positioned within the SpinnerContainer and has a background color of var(--ck-body-background). The Spinner component is a simple spinner that rotates continuously. It is also positioned within the SpinnerContainer. \n\nThese components can be used in the larger Oxygenium web3 project to display the logo and spinner animations. For example, the LogoContainer component can be used as a wrapper for the Logo and Spinner components in a loading screen or splash page. The Spinner component can be used to indicate that a process is in progress, while the ExpiringSpinner component can be used to indicate that a process is about to expire. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of reusable styled components that can be used throughout the Oxygenium web3 project to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.",

  "summary": "The `CircleSpinner` component, located in the `index.tsx` file, is a crucial part of the Oxygenium Web3 project as it provides a visual indication of loading or connecting states. It is a React component that renders a circular spinner animation with an optional logo. The component accepts several props, such as `logo`, `smallLogo`, `connecting`, `unavailable`, and `countdown`, which allow customization of the spinner's appearance and behavior.\n\nThe spinner animation is created using SVG and Framer Motion, with the `AnimatePresence` component animating the spinner in and out of the DOM. Depending on the provided props, the spinner can have different animations, such as a fade-in animation when `connecting` is true or a countdown animation when `countdown` is true.\n\nIn the `styles.ts` file, you'll find styled components for the logo and spinner, which define the appearance of these elements. The `LogoContainer` component acts as a wrapper for the logo and spinner components, while the `ExpiringSpinner` and `Spinner` components represent different spinner animations.\n\nThe `CircleSpinner` component can be used in various parts of the Oxygenium Web3 project to indicate loading or connecting states. For instance, it can be combined with other components to create a more complex loading or connecting UI, such as in a modal or overlay to indicate a background process.\n\nHere's an example of how the `CircleSpinner` component might be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport CircleSpinner from 'oxygenium-web3/components/CircleSpinner'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CircleSpinner connecting />\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CircleSpinner` component is used alongside a paragraph element to display a loading message. The spinner will be visible and animated when the `connecting` prop is true. This component can be easily integrated into various parts of the Oxygenium Web3 project, providing a consistent and visually appealing user interface for loading and connecting states.",
