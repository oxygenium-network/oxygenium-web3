  "summary": "The `OxygeniumConnectProvider` component is a React functional component that provides a context for the Oxygenium Connect modal. This component is part of the Oxygenium Web3 project and is used to connect to the Oxygenium blockchain network.\n\nThe component takes in several props, including `useTheme`, `useMode`, `useCustomTheme`, `network`, `addressGroup`, `keyType`, and `children`. These props are used to configure the Oxygenium Connect modal and the context that it provides.\n\nThe `OxygeniumConnectProvider` component uses the `useContext` hook to check if the context has already been mounted. If it has, an error is thrown to prevent multiple instances of the context from being created.\n\nThe component also uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of several variables, including `theme`, `mode`, `customTheme`, `open`, `connectorId`, `route`, `account`, `errorMessage`, and `signerProvider`. These variables are used to manage the state of the Oxygenium Connect modal and the context that it provides.\n\nThe `OxygeniumConnectProvider` component returns a `ThemeProvider` component from the `styled-components` library, which is used to provide a default theme for the modal. The `children` prop is also returned, which allows other components to be nested within the `OxygeniumConnectProvider` component.\n\nFinally, the `OxygeniumConnectModal` component is returned, which is the actual modal that is displayed to the user. This component takes in the `theme`, `mode`, and `customTheme` props, which are used to customize the appearance of the modal.\n\nOverall, the `OxygeniumConnectProvider` component is an important part of the Oxygenium Web3 project, as it provides a context for the Oxygenium Connect modal and allows users to connect to the Oxygenium blockchain network.",
