      "summary": "This file contains code for the Alephium Connect Button component, which is a button that allows users to connect their Alephium wallet to a web application. The component is written in React and uses several other components and hooks from the Alephium-web3 project.\n\nThe `AlephiumConnectButton` component is the main component that renders the button. It takes several props, including an optional label, an optional `onClick` function, and an optional `displayAccount` function. When the button is clicked, it opens a modal that allows the user to connect their wallet or view their profile.\n\nThe `ConnectButtonRenderer` component is a helper component that renders the content of the modal. It takes a `displayAccount` prop that is used to display the user's account information in the modal. The `ConnectButtonRenderer` component is used internally by the `AlephiumConnectButton` component, but can also be used externally if a custom modal is desired.\n\nThe `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook is used to access the Alephium Connect context, which contains information about the user's wallet connection status and theme. The `useAccount` hook is used to access the user's account information, including their address.\n\nThe `AnimatePresence` and `Variants` components from the `framer-motion` library are used to animate the modal when it is opened and closed. The `TextContainer` and `ThemedButton` components are custom components that are styled using CSS-in-JS.\n\nOverall, this file contains code for a button component that allows users to connect their Alephium wallet to a web application. The component is highly customizable and can be used in a variety of contexts.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is a React component that renders a button for connecting to the Alephium network. It uses various animations to display the user's account information or a \"Connect Alephium\" message depending on whether the user is connected or not.\n\n2. What is the license for this code and where can I find more information about it?\n- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License. More information about this license can be found at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\n\n3. Can I customize the display of the user's account information in the button?\n- Yes, the `AlephiumConnectButton` component accepts a `displayAccount` prop that takes a function to customize the display of the user's account information. If this prop is not provided, the default behavior is to display the user's account address."

      "summary": "This code defines a styled component called `TextContainer` using the `styled-components` library. The component is a `motion.div` element imported from the `framer-motion` library, which provides animation capabilities. The `TextContainer` component is designed to be used as a container for text elements, with properties that center and align the text within the container.\n\nThe `styled` function is used to create a styled component by passing in the `motion.div` element as an argument. The resulting `TextContainer` component has CSS properties applied to it, including `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `display`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, and `white-space`. These properties are used to position and style the text within the container.\n\nThe `TextContainer` component is exported as a named export, which means it can be imported and used in other files within the project. For example, if a developer wanted to create a text element that was centered and animated, they could import the `TextContainer` component and use it as a wrapper for their text element. Here is an example of how the `TextContainer` component could be used:\n\n```\nimport { TextContainer } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst MyText = () => {\n  return (\n    <TextContainer animate={{ scale: 1.2 }} transition={{ duration: 1 }}>\n      <h1>Hello World!</h1>\n    </TextContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `TextContainer` component is used to wrap an `h1` element that says \"Hello World!\". The `animate` and `transition` props are passed to the `TextContainer` component to provide animation effects. When the component is rendered, the text will be centered within the container and will scale up by 20% over a duration of 1 second.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable component for text elements that need to be centered and animated within a container. It demonstrates the use of styled components and the `framer-motion` library to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is part of the oxygenium project and defines a styled component called `TextContainer` using the `styled` function from the `styled-components` library.\n\n2. What is the significance of the imported libraries `framer-motion` and `styled-components`?\n- `framer-motion` is a library for creating animations and interactive UI components in React, and is used to define the `motion` component that is imported and used in this file. `styled-components` is a library for styling React components using CSS-in-JS, and is used to define the `TextContainer` component.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
