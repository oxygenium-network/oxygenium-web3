  "summary": "This file contains code for the Alephium Connect Button component, which is a button that allows users to connect their Alephium wallet to a web application. The component is written in React and uses several other components and hooks from the Alephium-web3 project.\n\nThe `AlephiumConnectButton` component is the main component that renders the button. It takes several props, including an optional label, an optional `onClick` function, and an optional `displayAccount` function. When the button is clicked, it opens a modal that allows the user to connect their wallet or view their profile.\n\nThe `ConnectButtonRenderer` component is a helper component that renders the content of the modal. It takes a `displayAccount` prop that is used to display the user's account information in the modal. The `ConnectButtonRenderer` component is used internally by the `AlephiumConnectButton` component, but can also be used externally if a custom modal is desired.\n\nThe `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook is used to access the Alephium Connect context, which contains information about the user's wallet connection status and theme. The `useAccount` hook is used to access the user's account information, including their address.\n\nThe `AnimatePresence` and `Variants` components from the `framer-motion` library are used to animate the modal when it is opened and closed. The `TextContainer` and `ThemedButton` components are custom components that are styled using CSS-in-JS.\n\nOverall, this file contains code for a button component that allows users to connect their Alephium wallet to a web application. The component is highly customizable and can be used in a variety of contexts.",
