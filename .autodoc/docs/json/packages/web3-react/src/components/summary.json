      "summary": "The `AlephiumConnectProvider` component is a React functional component that provides a context for the Alephium Connect modal. This component is part of the Alephium Web3 project and is used to connect to the Alephium blockchain network.\n\nThe component takes in several props, including `useTheme`, `useMode`, `useCustomTheme`, `network`, `addressGroup`, `keyType`, and `children`. These props are used to configure the Alephium Connect modal and the context that it provides.\n\nThe `AlephiumConnectProvider` component uses the `useContext` hook to check if the context has already been mounted. If it has, an error is thrown to prevent multiple instances of the context from being created.\n\nThe component also uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of several variables, including `theme`, `mode`, `customTheme`, `open`, `connectorId`, `route`, `account`, `errorMessage`, and `signerProvider`. These variables are used to manage the state of the Alephium Connect modal and the context that it provides.\n\nThe `AlephiumConnectProvider` component returns a `ThemeProvider` component from the `styled-components` library, which is used to provide a default theme for the modal. The `children` prop is also returned, which allows other components to be nested within the `AlephiumConnectProvider` component.\n\nFinally, the `AlephiumConnectModal` component is returned, which is the actual modal that is displayed to the user. This component takes in the `theme`, `mode`, and `customTheme` props, which are used to customize the appearance of the modal.\n\nOverall, the `AlephiumConnectProvider` component is an important part of the Alephium Web3 project, as it provides a context for the Alephium Connect modal and allows users to connect to the Alephium blockchain network.",

              "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Alert` that can be used to display alerts on a web page. The component takes two props: `children` and `icon`. The `children` prop is used to pass in the content of the alert, while the `icon` prop is used to pass in an optional icon to be displayed alongside the content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is defined using the `React.forwardRef` function, which allows the component to forward a ref to one of its children. This is useful when the component needs to access the DOM node of one of its children, for example to set focus or measure its size.\n\nThe `Alert` component renders a container element with the class `AlertContainer`, which is defined in a separate file. If the `icon` prop is provided, the component also renders an `IconContainer` element with the `icon` prop as its child. Finally, the component renders a `div` element with the `children` prop as its content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, a parent component could use the `Alert` component to display an error message to the user:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Alert from 'oxygenium-web3/Alert'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)\n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n    try {\n      // some code that might throw an error\n    } catch (error) {\n      setError(error.message)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>\n      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message. Finally, the component renders an `Alert` component with the `error` message as its content, which is displayed to the user.",

It is a flex container with a gap of 8px between its child elements. It has a position of relative and a border radius of 9px. The `padding`, `text-align`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-weight` properties are also set. The `max-width` is set to 260px and the `min-width` is set to 100%. The component also has CSS variables for `border-radius`, `color`, `background`, and `box-shadow` which can be customized. \n\nThe `IconContainer` component is a container for the icon that appears in the alert message. It has a fixed width and height of 24px and is a flex container with its child elements centered both horizontally and vertically. The SVG icon is set to display block and has a width of 100% and height of auto. \n\nThese components are used to create alert messages throughout the Alephium web3 project. For example, an alert message could be created with the following code:\n\n```\nimport { AlertContainer, IconContainer } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst MyAlert = () => {\n  return (\n    <AlertContainer>\n      <IconContainer>\n        <svg>...</svg>\n      </IconContainer>\n      <div>Alert message goes here</div>\n    </AlertContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis would create an alert message with an icon and the text \"Alert message goes here\" inside the `AlertContainer`.

The `ButtonProps` interface includes optional properties for the button's `children` (the text or other content displayed on the button), `variant` (one of three possible styles for the button), `disabled` (whether the button is disabled), `icon` (an optional icon to display on the button), `iconPosition` (whether the icon should be displayed to the left or right of the button text), `roundedIcon` (whether the icon should be displayed with rounded corners), `waiting` (whether the button is in a \"waiting\" state), `arrow` (whether the button should display an arrow), `download` (whether the button should initiate a download), `href` (the URL to navigate to when the button is clicked), `style` (additional CSS styles to apply to the button), and `onClick` (a callback function to execute when the button is clicked).\n\nThis interface is intended to be used as a type for the props passed to a React component representing a button. By defining the `ButtonProps` interface, the component can ensure that it only receives valid props and can provide type checking and autocompletion for those props in development environments.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface might be used in a React component:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { ButtonProps } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, variant = 'primary', disabled = false, onClick }) => {\n  return (\n    <button className={`button ${variant}`} disabled={disabled} onClick={onClick}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Button\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Button` component is defined as a functional component that accepts a single argument of type `ButtonProps`. The component uses destructuring to extract the `children`, `variant`, `disabled`, and `onClick` props from the `ButtonProps` object. The component then renders a standard HTML `button` element with the appropriate class name, disabled state, and click handler based on the props passed to it. By using the `ButtonProps` interface to define the expected props for the `Button` component, the component can ensure that it only receives valid props and can provide type checking and autocompletion for those props in development environments.",

It provides features like transitions, animations, and focus trapping, making it a versatile and user-friendly UI element.\n\nThe component is built using `styled-components` for CSS-in-JS styling and `framer-motion` for handling animations and transitions. It consists of several styled components and animations, such as `ErrorMessage`, `PageContent`, `BackgroundOverlay`, and `ModalContainer`, which define the structure, styling, and animations for the modal and its content.\n\nThe `Modal` component accepts several props to control its behavior, such as `open`, `pages`, `pageId`, `positionInside`, `inline`, `onClose`, `onBack`, and `onInfo`. These props allow you to customize the modal's visibility, content, positioning, and event handlers for closing, going back, and showing more information.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Modal` component can be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport Modal, { routes, OrDivider } from './Modal';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleModalClose = () => {\n    setModalOpen(false);\n  };\n\n  const pages = [\n    {\n      id: routes.CONNECTORS,\n      content: <div>Connectors Content</div>,\n    },\n    {\n      id: routes.PROFILE,\n      content: <div>Profile Content</div>,\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>\n      <Modal\n        open={modalOpen}\n        pages={pages}\n        pageId={routes.CONNECTORS}\n        onClose={handleModalClose}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, a button is used to open the modal, and the `handleModalClose` function is passed as the `onClose` prop to close the modal. The `pages` array contains the content for each page within the modal, and the `pageId` prop is set to display the \"Connectors\" page initially.\n\nThe `Modal` component uses custom hooks like `useTransition`, `useFocusTrap`, and `usePrevious` to manage its state, focus management, and previous values. This makes the component more modular and easier to maintain, as the logic is separated from the presentation.\n\nIn summary, the `Modal` component in the Alephium-web3 project is a flexible and customizable UI element that can be used throughout the application for various purposes. Its combination of styled-components, framer-motion, and custom hooks makes it a powerful and user-friendly component that can enhance the overall user experience.",

It also sets the position to relative, height to 40px, padding to 0, line-height to 0, letter-spacing to -0.2px, font-size to 16px, and font-weight to 500. It also sets the text-align to center and applies a transition effect to color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `Container` component has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. The `primary` variant sets the `--color`, `--background`, `--box-shadow`, and `--border-radius` CSS variables to specific values. It also sets the `--hover-color`, `--hover-background`, `--hover-box-shadow`, and `--hover-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it sets the `--active-color`, `--active-background`, `--active-box-shadow`, and `--active-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is clicked. \n\nThe `secondary` variant is similar to the `primary` variant, but it sets different CSS variables for the button's color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component is a styled button that sets all CSS properties to initial values and sets the appearance to none.

This allows for easy creation of reusable styled components that can be used throughout the Alephium web3 project.\n\nThe `types.ts` file contains TypeScript type definitions for the tooltip component, such as `TooltipSizeProps` and `TooltipProps`. These type definitions ensure that the tooltip component is used correctly throughout the Alephium project and make it easier to maintain and update the component in the future.\n\nIn summary, the `Tooltip` component in the `oxygenium-web3` project provides a flexible and visually appealing way to display additional information when the user hovers over a specific element on the page. The component is defined in the `index.tsx` file, styled in the `styles.ts` file, and has its types defined in the `types.ts` file. This modular approach makes it easy to maintain and update the tooltip component as the project evolves.",

The `ConnectingContainer` component is a container for the loading spinner and has a fixed height of 120px and is centered horizontally and vertically within its parent container. The `ConnectingAnimation` component is the actual loading spinner and has two animation keyframes applied to it: `shakeKeyframes` and `outlineKeyframes`. The `shakeKeyframes` animation causes the spinner to shake back and forth horizontally, while the `outlineKeyframes` animation causes a red outline to appear around the spinner and then fade out. The `RetryButton` component is a button that appears when there is an error and allows the user to retry the action. It has a fixed position in the bottom right corner of its parent container and has a circular shape with a 32px diameter. The `RetryIconContainer` component is a container for the retry button icon and has a conic gradient applied to it. \n\nThese components are used throughout the Alephium web3 project to provide visual feedback to the user during loading and error states. For example, the `ConnectingContainer` component may be used when the user is waiting for a transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain, while the `RetryButton` component may be used when there is an error fetching data from a remote server. The use of styled components allows for easy customization of the visual appearance of these components, making it simple to match the design of the loading spinner and retry button to the overall look and feel of the Alephium web3 project.",

(\n        <LoadingBalance />\n      ) : (\n        <Balance>{balance}</Balance>\n      )}\n    </BalanceContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountBalance` component fetches the user's balance from the server and displays it using the `Balance` component. While the balance is being fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is displayed instead. The `BalanceContainer` component is used to position the balance display on the web page.",

      "summary": "The `Pages` folder in the Alephium web3 project contains components related to the main user interface, such as connecting wallets and displaying account information. It consists of two subfolders: `Connectors` and `Profile`.\n\nThe `Connectors` component in `index.tsx` is a crucial part of the Alephium Web3 project, as it enables users to connect their wallets to the Alephium network. It renders a list of supported wallet connectors based on the user's device type (mobile or desktop) and allows users to select the desired connector. The component imports the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook, which provides access to the current connector and route, and the `supportedConnectors` constant, which defines the various wallet connectors supported by the Alephium network.\n\nThe `styles.ts` file contains styled components for the user interface, including `ConnectorsContainer`, `ConnectorButton`, `MobileConnectorsContainer`, and `MobileConnectorButton`. These components are designed to display a list of available connectors to the user and initiate connections to the corresponding blockchain networks. The use of styled components allows for easy customization of the appearance of these buttons, ensuring a consistent user interface across different parts of the application.\n\nHere's an example of how these components might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ConnectorsContainer, ConnectorButton } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction ConnectorList() {\n  return (\n    <ConnectorsContainer>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Ethereum</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><EthereumIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Binance Smart Chain</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><BinanceIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Polkadot</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><PolkadotIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n    </ConnectorsContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ConnectorList` function renders a `ConnectorsContainer` component containing three `ConnectorButton` components for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot networks. Each button includes a label and an icon, and when clicked, initiates a connection to the corresponding network.\n\nThe `Profile` folder in the Alephium web3 project contains code related to displaying the user's account information and balance, as well as providing a way to disconnect from the Alephium network.
