      "summary": "This file contains the implementation of a React component called `Button`. The `Button` component is a reusable UI element that can be used throughout the project to create clickable buttons with various styles and features. \n\nThe `Button` component takes in several props, including `children`, `variant`, `disabled`, `icon`, `iconPosition`, `roundedIcon`, `waiting`, `arrow`, `download`, `href`, `style`, and `onClick`. \n\nThe `children` prop is used to specify the text or content of the button. The `variant` prop is used to specify the style of the button, with the default being `secondary`. The `disabled` prop is used to disable the button. The `icon` prop is used to specify an icon to be displayed on the button. The `iconPosition` prop is used to specify the position of the icon, with the default being `left`. The `roundedIcon` prop is used to specify whether the icon should be rounded. The `waiting` prop is used to display a spinner animation on the button. The `arrow` prop is used to display an arrow icon on the button. The `download` prop is used to display a download arrow icon on the button. The `href` prop is used to specify the URL that the button should link to. The `style` prop is used to specify additional CSS styles for the button. The `onClick` prop is used to specify a function to be called when the button is clicked.\n\nThe `Button` component uses several other components and styles defined in this file, including `ButtonContainer`, `InnerContainer`, `IconContainer`, `Arrow`, `ArrowLine`, `ArrowChevron`, `DownloadArrow`, `DownloadArrowInner`, `SpinnerContainer`, and `ButtonContainerInner`. These components and styles are used to create the visual appearance of the button and its various features.\n\nOverall, the `Button` component is a flexible and customizable UI element that can be used throughout the project to create clickable buttons with various styles and features. It can be used to link to other pages, trigger functions, or perform other actions as needed.",

The `ButtonContainer` component also includes hover and active states that change the background color, box shadow, and arrow icon position.\n\nThe `defaultTheme` constant is imported from a separate file and used to set the mobile width breakpoint for the button styles.\n\nOverall, this file provides reusable styled components for buttons and icons that can be used throughout the Oxygenium web3 project. Developers can customize the appearance of buttons by passing different values for the `$variant` prop, and can add icons with optional rounded borders using the `IconContainer` component.",

      "summary": "This code defines a TypeScript interface called `ButtonProps` that describes the properties that can be passed to a React component representing a button. The `ButtonProps` interface includes optional properties for the button's `children` (the text or other content displayed on the button), `variant` (one of three possible styles for the button), `disabled` (whether the button is disabled), `icon` (an optional icon to display on the button), `iconPosition` (whether the icon should be displayed to the left or right of the button text), `roundedIcon` (whether the icon should be displayed with rounded corners), `waiting` (whether the button is in a \"waiting\" state), `arrow` (whether the button should display an arrow), `download` (whether the button should initiate a download), `href` (the URL to navigate to when the button is clicked), `style` (additional CSS styles to apply to the button), and `onClick` (a callback function to execute when the button is clicked).\n\nThis interface is intended to be used as a type for the props passed to a React component representing a button. By defining the `ButtonProps` interface, the component can ensure that it only receives valid props and can provide type checking and autocompletion for those props in development environments.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface might be used in a React component:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { ButtonProps } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nconst Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, variant = 'primary', disabled = false, onClick }) => {\n  return (\n    <button className={`button ${variant}`} disabled={disabled} onClick={onClick}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Button\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Button` component is defined as a functional component that accepts a single argument of type `ButtonProps`. The component uses destructuring to extract the `children`, `variant`, `disabled`, and `onClick` props from the `ButtonProps` object. The component then renders a standard HTML `button` element with the appropriate class name, disabled state, and click handler based on the props passed to it. By using the `ButtonProps` interface to define the expected props for the `Button` component, the component can ensure that it only receives valid props and can provide type checking and autocompletion for those props in development environments.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is a React component that defines the props for a button.\n\n2. What are the available variants for the button?\n- The available variants for the button are 'primary', 'secondary', and 'tertiary'.\n\n3. Can the button have an icon and if so, can it be positioned on either the left or right side?\n- Yes, the button can have an icon and it can be positioned on either the left or right side using the 'icon' and 'iconPosition' props."

  "summary": "The `Button` component in the `index.tsx` file is a reusable and customizable UI element that can be used throughout the Oxygenium web3 project to create clickable buttons with various styles and features. It accepts a wide range of props, allowing developers to easily configure the appearance and behavior of the button. For example, a developer can create a primary button with an icon and a click handler like this:\n\n```tsx\nimport Button from 'oxygenium-web3/components/Common/Button'\n\n<Button variant=\"primary\" icon=\"plus\" onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')}>\n  Add Item\n</Button>\n```\n\nThe `styles.ts` file contains styled components for buttons and icons, which are used by the `Button` component to create its visual appearance. Developers can customize the appearance of buttons by passing different values for the `$variant` prop, and can add icons with optional rounded borders using the `IconContainer` component.\n\nThe `types.ts` file defines a TypeScript interface called `ButtonProps`, which is used as a type for the props passed to the `Button` component.

The component is built using styled components and TypeScript, ensuring a consistent appearance and strong type checking for its props.",
