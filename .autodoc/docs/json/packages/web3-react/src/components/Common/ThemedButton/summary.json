      "summary": "The `ThemedButton` component is a React functional component that renders a button with a customizable theme. It takes in several props, including `children`, which is the content of the button, `variant`, which determines the color scheme of the button, `autoSize`, which determines whether the button should automatically adjust its width to fit its content, `duration`, which determines the duration of the animation when the button is clicked, and `style`, which allows for additional custom styling.\n\nThe component uses the `useMeasure` hook from the `react-use-measure` library to measure the size of the button content and adjust the button width accordingly. The `Container` component is a styled component that renders the button with the appropriate theme and animation. The `ThemeContainer` component is also exported, but it is not used in this file.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to render customizable buttons with different color schemes and animations. For example, it could be used in a web application to render a primary button with a blue color scheme and a secondary button with a gray color scheme. The `autoSize` prop could be set to `false` for buttons with fixed widths, and the `duration` prop could be adjusted to change the animation speed. Overall, this component provides a flexible and reusable way to render buttons with different styles and behaviors. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport ThemedButton from './ThemedButton'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"primary\" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>\n        Click me!\n      </ThemedButton>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"secondary\" autoSize={false}>\n        Fixed width button\n      </ThemedButton>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code exports a React component called `ThemedButton` that renders a button with customizable styles and animations.\n\n2. What are the available props for the `ThemedButton` component and what do they do?\n- The available props are `children` (the content of the button), `variant` (the style variant of the button), `autoSize` (whether the button should adjust its width to fit its content), `duration` (the duration of the animation), and `style` (additional CSS styles for the button). The `onClick` prop is also available to handle click events.\n\n3. What is the license for this code and where can I find more information about it?\n- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.

      "summary": "This file contains two styled components, `Container` and `ThemeContainer`, which are used to style buttons in the Oxygenium Web3 project. \n\nThe `Container` component is a `motion.div` styled component that accepts a `$variant` prop. It sets the display to flex, aligns items to the center, and justifies content to the start. It also sets the position to relative, height to 40px, padding to 0, line-height to 0, letter-spacing to -0.2px, font-size to 16px, and font-weight to 500. It also sets the text-align to center and applies a transition effect to color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `Container` component has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. The `primary` variant sets the `--color`, `--background`, `--box-shadow`, and `--border-radius` CSS variables to specific values. It also sets the `--hover-color`, `--hover-background`, `--hover-box-shadow`, and `--hover-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it sets the `--active-color`, `--active-background`, `--active-box-shadow`, and `--active-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is clicked. \n\nThe `secondary` variant is similar to the `primary` variant, but it sets different CSS variables for the button's color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component is a styled button that sets all CSS properties to initial values and sets the appearance to none. It also sets the user-select to none, position to relative, padding to 0, margin to 0, and background to none. It sets the border-radius to a CSS variable `--ck-border-radius`. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component has a `disabled` state that sets the pointer-events to none and opacity to 0.3. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component also has a hover state that changes the color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius of the `Container` component when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it has an active state that changes these properties when the button is clicked. \n\nThese styled components can be used to create buttons with different styles throughout the Oxygenium Web3 project. For example, a button with the `primary` variant can be used for primary actions, while a button with the `secondary` variant can be used for secondary actions. The `ThemeContainer` component can be used to wrap any content that needs to be styled as a button.",

What is the purpose of the `framer-motion` and `styled` imports?\n- The `framer-motion` library is used to add animation to the styled components, while the `styled` import is used to create the styled components themselves."
