  "summary": "The `ThemedButton` component is a React functional component that renders a button with a customizable theme. It takes in several props, including `children`, which is the content of the button, `variant`, which determines the color scheme of the button, `autoSize`, which determines whether the button should automatically adjust its width to fit its content, `duration`, which determines the duration of the animation when the button is clicked, and `style`, which allows for additional custom styling.\n\nThe component uses the `useMeasure` hook from the `react-use-measure` library to measure the size of the button content and adjust the button width accordingly. The `Container` component is a styled component that renders the button with the appropriate theme and animation. The `ThemeContainer` component is also exported, but it is not used in this file.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to render customizable buttons with different color schemes and animations. For example, it could be used in a web application to render a primary button with a blue color scheme and a secondary button with a gray color scheme. The `autoSize` prop could be set to `false` for buttons with fixed widths, and the `duration` prop could be adjusted to change the animation speed. Overall, this component provides a flexible and reusable way to render buttons with different styles and behaviors. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport ThemedButton from './ThemedButton'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"primary\" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>\n        Click me!\n      </ThemedButton>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"secondary\" autoSize={false}>\n        Fixed width button\n      </ThemedButton>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
