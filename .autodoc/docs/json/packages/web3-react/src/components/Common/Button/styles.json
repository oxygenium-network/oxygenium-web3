  "summary": "This file contains styled components for buttons and icons used in the Alephium web3 project. The `SpinnerContainer` component is used to display a spinning animation, while the `ButtonContainer` component is used to create buttons with different styles based on the `$variant` prop. The `InnerContainer` component is used to wrap text and icons within a button, while the `IconContainer` component is used to display icons with optional rounded borders.\n\nThe `Arrow`, `ArrowChevron`, `ArrowLine`, `DownloadArrow`, and `DownloadArrowInner` components are used to create an arrow icon that is displayed next to text in a button. The `ButtonContainer` component also includes hover and active states that change the background color, box shadow, and arrow icon position.\n\nThe `defaultTheme` constant is imported from a separate file and used to set the mobile width breakpoint for the button styles.\n\nOverall, this file provides reusable styled components for buttons and icons that can be used throughout the Alephium web3 project. Developers can customize the appearance of buttons by passing different values for the `$variant` prop, and can add icons with optional rounded borders using the `IconContainer` component.",
