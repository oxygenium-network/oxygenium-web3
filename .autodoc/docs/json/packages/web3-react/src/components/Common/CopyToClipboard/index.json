  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `CopyToClipboard` that provides a way to copy a given string to the clipboard. The component can be used in two ways: as a standalone component that displays a copy icon and the given string, or as a button that displays the given string and the copy icon. \n\nThe component is styled using the `styled-components` library, which allows for the creation of custom CSS styles using JavaScript. The `Container` and `OffsetContainer` components define the styles for the copy icon and the string, respectively. The `Button` component is imported from another file and is used to create the button variant of the `CopyToClipboard` component.\n\nThe `CopyToClipboard` component takes three props: `string`, `children`, and `variant`. The `string` prop is the string that will be copied to the clipboard when the user clicks the copy icon or button. The `children` prop is the content that will be displayed alongside the copy icon or button. The `variant` prop determines whether the component should be rendered as a standalone component or a button.\n\nWhen the user clicks the copy icon or button, the `onCopy` function is called. This function first checks if a string has been provided. If not, it returns early. If a string has been provided, it is trimmed and then copied to the clipboard using the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` method if available. If `navigator.clipboard.writeText` is not available, a fallback method is used to copy the string to the clipboard. After the string has been copied, the `clipboard` state is set to `true` to indicate that the copy was successful. The `clipboard` state is reset to `false` after one second using a `setTimeout` function.\n\nOverall, this component provides a simple way to copy a string to the clipboard in a React application. It can be used in various contexts, such as copying a URL or a code snippet.",
