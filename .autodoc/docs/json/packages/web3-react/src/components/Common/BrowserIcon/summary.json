      "summary": "This code defines a React component called `BrowserIcon` that renders an icon for a web browser. The component takes a `browser` prop that specifies which browser to render an icon for. If the `browser` prop is not provided, the component will attempt to detect the current browser using the `detectBrowser` utility function from the `utils` module.\n\nThe `detectBrowser` function is not defined in this file, but it is likely a utility function that uses the `window.navigator.userAgent` property to determine the current browser. The `detectBrowser` function is imported from the `utils` module, which suggests that this component is part of a larger web application.\n\nThe `browsers` object is imported from the `assets/browsers` module, which contains SVG icons for each supported browser. The `BrowserIcon` component uses a `switch` statement to select the appropriate icon based on the `currentBrowser` value. If the `currentBrowser` value is not one of the supported browsers, the component returns an empty fragment.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is a functional component that uses the `React.forwardRef` function to forward a ref to the underlying DOM element. The component renders the selected icon inside a `BrowserIconContainer` component, which is defined in the `styles` module.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other modules. The `displayName` property is set to `'BrowserIcon'`, which is used by React for debugging purposes.\n\nOverall, this code defines a reusable React component that renders an icon for a web browser based on the `browser` prop or the current browser detected by the `detectBrowser` utility function. The component is likely used in a larger web application to provide browser-specific functionality or styling.",

      "summary": "This code defines a styled component called `BrowserIconContainer` using the `styled-components` library. The component is a `motion.div` element that displays an SVG icon in the center of the container. The `motion` object is imported from the `framer-motion` library, which provides animation capabilities to React components. \n\nThe `BrowserIconContainer` component is designed to be used in a larger project that requires a browser icon. By importing this component, developers can easily add a browser icon to their application without having to write the CSS styling themselves. The component is responsive and will adjust its size to fit the available space. \n\nHere is an example of how the `BrowserIconContainer` component can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { BrowserIconContainer } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>\n      <BrowserIconContainer>\n        <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n          <path d=\"M12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12s4.5 10 10 10 10-4.5 10-10S17.5 2 12 2zm0 18c-4.4 0-8-3.6-8-8s3.6-8 8-8 8 3.6 8 8-3.6 8-8 8z\"/>\n        </svg>\n      </BrowserIconContainer>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `BrowserIconContainer` component is used to display a browser icon in the center of the page. The SVG code for the icon is passed as a child element to the `BrowserIconContainer` component. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable and responsive styled component for displaying a browser icon in a React application.",
