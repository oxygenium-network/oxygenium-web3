      "summary": "This code defines a React component called `CopyToClipboardIcon` that renders an icon used for copying content to the clipboard. The component imports `styled-components` and `framer-motion` libraries to style the icon and add animation effects. \n\nThe `IconContainer` styled component defines the styles for the icon container. It uses `motion.div` from `framer-motion` to add animation effects to the container. The `IconContainer` component has a `$clipboard` prop that is used to determine whether the icon is in a \"copied\" state. If `$clipboard` is true, the icon is styled with a different color and animation effect. \n\nThe `CopyToClipboardIcon` component takes two optional props: `copied` and `small`. If `copied` is true, the icon is styled with the `$clipboard` prop set to true, indicating that the content has been copied to the clipboard. If `small` is true, the icon is rendered in a smaller size. \n\nThis component can be used in other components or pages of the Oxygenium Web3 project to provide a UI element for copying content to the clipboard. For example, it could be used in a form component to allow users to copy a generated password or API key to the clipboard. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport CopyToClipboardIcon from './path/to/CopyToClipboardIcon'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false)\n\n  const handleCopy = () => {\n    // copy content to clipboard\n    setCopied(true)\n    setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), 2000) // reset copied state after 2 seconds\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleCopy}>\n        Copy to clipboard\n        <CopyToClipboardIcon copied={copied} />\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `CopyToClipboardIcon` component is used inside a button element to provide a UI element for copying content to the clipboard. The `copied` prop is set to `true` when the content is successfully copied to the clipboard, triggering the animation effect.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code exports a component called `CopyToClipboardIcon` that renders an icon with animation and styling based on whether it has been copied to the clipboard or not.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports `styled-components` and `motion` from `framer-motion`. It also imports an icon component from a file located at `../../../assets/icons`.\n\n3.

      "summary": "This code defines a React component called `CopyToClipboard` that provides a way to copy a given string to the clipboard. The component can be used in two ways: as a standalone component that displays a copy icon and the given string, or as a button that displays the given string and the copy icon. \n\nThe component is styled using the `styled-components` library, which allows for the creation of custom CSS styles using JavaScript. The `Container` and `OffsetContainer` components define the styles for the copy icon and the string, respectively. The `Button` component is imported from another file and is used to create the button variant of the `CopyToClipboard` component.\n\nThe `CopyToClipboard` component takes three props: `string`, `children`, and `variant`. The `string` prop is the string that will be copied to the clipboard when the user clicks the copy icon or button. The `children` prop is the content that will be displayed alongside the copy icon or button. The `variant` prop determines whether the component should be rendered as a standalone component or a button.\n\nWhen the user clicks the copy icon or button, the `onCopy` function is called. This function first checks if a string has been provided. If not, it returns early. If a string has been provided, it is trimmed and then copied to the clipboard using the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` method if available. If `navigator.clipboard.writeText` is not available, a fallback method is used to copy the string to the clipboard. After the string has been copied, the `clipboard` state is set to `true` to indicate that the copy was successful. The `clipboard` state is reset to `false` after one second using a `setTimeout` function.\n\nOverall, this component provides a simple way to copy a string to the clipboard in a React application. It can be used in various contexts, such as copying a URL or a code snippet.",

The `variant` prop is set to `\"button\"` to render the component as a button, and the `children` prop is used to display the text \"Copy URL\" alongside the copy icon.\n\nOverall, the `CopyToClipboard` component and its related files provide a flexible and reusable way to add clipboard functionality to the `oxygenium-web3` project.",
