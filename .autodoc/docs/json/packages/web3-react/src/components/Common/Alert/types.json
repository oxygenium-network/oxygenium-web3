  "summary": "This code defines a TypeScript type called `AlertProps` that is exported for use in other parts of the Oxygenium project. The `AlertProps` type is an object that can have two properties: `children` and `icon`. The `children` property is of type `React.ReactNode`, which means it can accept any valid React node as its value. The `icon` property is also of type `React.ReactNode`, which means it can accept any valid React node as its value.\n\nThis type is likely used in components that display alerts or notifications to the user. By defining this type, the Oxygenium project can ensure that any components that use alerts or notifications have consistent props and can be easily maintained and updated.\n\nHere is an example of how this type might be used in a React component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { AlertProps } from 'oxygenium-web3';\n\nconst Alert: React.FC<AlertProps> = ({ children, icon }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"alert\">\n      {icon && <div className=\"alert-icon\">{icon}</div>}\n      <div className=\"alert-content\">{children}</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Alert;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Alert` component accepts `AlertProps` as its props and uses the `children` and `icon` properties to render an alert. The `icon` property is optional, so it only renders if it is provided. This component can be used throughout the Oxygenium project to display alerts and notifications with consistent props.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file in the oxygenium-web3 project?\n- This file contains a type definition for AlertProps, which is likely used in other parts of the project to define the props for an alert component.\n\n2. What license is this project using?\n- The project is using the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the expected format for the children and icon props in AlertProps?\n- The children prop should be a React node, and the icon prop should also be a React node."
