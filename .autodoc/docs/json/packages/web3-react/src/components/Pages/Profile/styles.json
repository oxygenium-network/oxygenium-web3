  "summary": "This file contains code related to the balance display of the Oxygenium web application. It imports the necessary dependencies and exports three styled components: `BalanceContainer`, `Balance`, and `LoadingBalance`.\n\n`BalanceContainer` is a styled component that wraps around the `Balance` component. It is used to position the balance display on the web page.\n\n`Balance` is a styled component that displays the balance of the user's account. It is a child component of `BalanceContainer`.\n\n`LoadingBalance` is a styled component that displays a loading animation while the balance is being fetched from the server. It is also a child component of `BalanceContainer`.\n\nThe `PlaceholderKeyframes` constant is a keyframe animation that is used to animate the loading animation in `LoadingBalance`. It animates the background of the component to create a loading effect.\n\nThis code is part of the larger Oxygenium web application and is responsible for displaying the user's balance. The `Balance` component is rendered with the user's balance once it is fetched from the server. If the balance has not yet been fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is rendered instead. This provides a visual cue to the user that the balance is being loaded.\n\nHere is an example of how these components might be used in the larger Oxygenium web application:\n\n```\nimport { BalanceContainer, Balance, LoadingBalance } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction AccountBalance() {\n  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null)\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchBalance()\n  }, [])\n\n  async function fetchBalance() {\n    const balance = await fetch('/api/balance')\n    setBalance(balance)\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <BalanceContainer>\n      {loading ? (\n        <LoadingBalance />\n      ) : (\n        <Balance>{balance}</Balance>\n      )}\n    </BalanceContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountBalance` component fetches the user's balance from the server and displays it using the `Balance` component. While the balance is being fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is displayed instead. The `BalanceContainer` component is used to position the balance display on the web page.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains styled components for displaying balance information in the Oxygenium web3 project.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `LoadingBalance` component?\n- The `LoadingBalance` component is used to display a loading animation while balance information is being fetched.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n- This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
