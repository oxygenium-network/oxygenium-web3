      "summary": "This code defines a React functional component called `Profile` that displays the user's account information and balance. It imports several hooks and components from other files in the project, including `useOxygeniumConnectContext`, `useAccount`, `useBalance`, `AnimatePresence`, `prettifyAttoAlphAmount`, and `useConnect`. \n\nThe `Profile` component first retrieves the user's account and balance using the `useAccount` and `useBalance` hooks. It then renders the account address and balance in a modal dialog using the `ModalContent`, `ModalH1`, and `ModalBody` components. The balance is displayed using the `Balance` and `LoadingBalance` components, which use the `AnimatePresence` component to animate the transition between the two states. The `prettifyAttoAlphAmount` function is used to format the balance value.\n\nThe `Profile` component also renders a \"Disconnect\" button that calls the `useConnect` hook to disconnect the user from the Oxygenium network. When the button is clicked, the `shouldDisconnect` state variable is set to `true`, which triggers a side effect that disconnects the user and closes the modal dialog. If the `closeModal` prop is provided, the dialog is closed by calling the `closeModal` function. Otherwise, the `setOpen` function from the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook is called to close the dialog.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way for users to view their account information and balance, as well as to disconnect from the Oxygenium network. It can be used as part of a larger project that integrates with the Oxygenium blockchain.",

      "summary": "This file contains code related to the balance display of the Oxygenium web application. It imports the necessary dependencies and exports three styled components: `BalanceContainer`, `Balance`, and `LoadingBalance`.\n\n`BalanceContainer` is a styled component that wraps around the `Balance` component. It is used to position the balance display on the web page.\n\n`Balance` is a styled component that displays the balance of the user's account. It is a child component of `BalanceContainer`.\n\n`LoadingBalance` is a styled component that displays a loading animation while the balance is being fetched from the server. It is also a child component of `BalanceContainer`.\n\nThe `PlaceholderKeyframes` constant is a keyframe animation that is used to animate the loading animation in `LoadingBalance`. It animates the background of the component to create a loading effect.\n\nThis code is part of the larger Oxygenium web application and is responsible for displaying the user's balance. The `Balance` component is rendered with the user's balance once it is fetched from the server. If the balance has not yet been fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is rendered instead. This provides a visual cue to the user that the balance is being loaded.\n\nHere is an example of how these components might be used in the larger Oxygenium web application:\n\n```\nimport { BalanceContainer, Balance, LoadingBalance } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction AccountBalance() {\n  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null)\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchBalance()\n  }, [])\n\n  async function fetchBalance() {\n    const balance = await fetch('/api/balance')\n    setBalance(balance)\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <BalanceContainer>\n      {loading ? (\n        <LoadingBalance />\n      ) : (\n        <Balance>{balance}</Balance>\n      )}\n    </BalanceContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountBalance` component fetches the user's balance from the server and displays it using the `Balance` component. While the balance is being fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is displayed instead. The `BalanceContainer` component is used to position the balance display on the web page.",
