  "summary": "This file contains styled components for a user interface that displays various connectors for interacting with a blockchain network. The ConnectorsContainer component is a container for ConnectorButton components, which represent individual connectors. Each ConnectorButton has a label and an icon, and can be clicked to initiate a connection to the corresponding blockchain network. The MobileConnectorsContainer component is a similar container for MobileConnectorButton components, which are designed for display on mobile devices. \n\nThe styling for these components includes various CSS variables that can be customized to change the appearance of the buttons. For example, the --ck-primary-button-color variable sets the text color for the ConnectorButton component, and the --ck-primary-button-background variable sets the background color. The components also include various hover and active states that change the appearance of the buttons when they are interacted with. \n\nThese components are likely used in a larger project that involves interacting with a blockchain network. The ConnectorsContainer and MobileConnectorsContainer components are likely used to display a list of available connectors to the user, while the ConnectorButton and MobileConnectorButton components are used to initiate connections to those networks. The use of styled components allows for easy customization of the appearance of these buttons, which can be important for maintaining a consistent user interface across different parts of the application. \n\nExample usage of these components might look like:\n\n```\nimport { ConnectorsContainer, ConnectorButton } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction ConnectorList() {\n  return (\n    <ConnectorsContainer>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Ethereum</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><EthereumIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Binance Smart Chain</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><BinanceIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Polkadot</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><PolkadotIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n    </ConnectorsContainer>\n  )\n}\n```",
