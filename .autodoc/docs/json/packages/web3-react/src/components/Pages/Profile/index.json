  "summary": "This code defines a React functional component called `Profile` that displays the user's account information and balance. It imports several hooks and components from other files in the project, including `useOxygeniumConnectContext`, `useAccount`, `useBalance`, `AnimatePresence`, `prettifyAttoOxmAmount`, and `useConnect`. \n\nThe `Profile` component first retrieves the user's account and balance using the `useAccount` and `useBalance` hooks. It then renders the account address and balance in a modal dialog using the `ModalContent`, `ModalH1`, and `ModalBody` components. The balance is displayed using the `Balance` and `LoadingBalance` components, which use the `AnimatePresence` component to animate the transition between the two states. The `prettifyAttoOxmAmount` function is used to format the balance value.\n\nThe `Profile` component also renders a \"Disconnect\" button that calls the `useConnect` hook to disconnect the user from the Oxygenium network. When the button is clicked, the `shouldDisconnect` state variable is set to `true`, which triggers a side effect that disconnects the user and closes the modal dialog. If the `closeModal` prop is provided, the dialog is closed by calling the `closeModal` function. Otherwise, the `setOpen` function from the `useOxygeniumConnectContext` hook is called to close the dialog.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way for users to view their account information and balance, as well as to disconnect from the Oxygenium network. It can be used as part of a larger project that integrates with the Oxygenium blockchain.",
