  "summary": "This file is a module that exports various components, contexts, constants, and hooks related to the AlephiumConnectProvider. The AlephiumConnectProvider is a web3 provider that allows users to interact with the Alephium blockchain. \n\nThe exported components include AlephiumConnectProvider, which is a React component that wraps the entire application and provides access to the web3 provider. AlephiumConnectButton is another component that can be used to display a button that allows users to connect to the AlephiumConnectProvider. \n\nThe exported contexts include useAlephiumConnectContext, which is a React hook that provides access to the AlephiumConnectProvider context. This context can be used to access the web3 provider and other related information. \n\nThe exported constants include supportedConnectors, which is an array of objects that represent the supported web3 connectors that can be used to connect to the AlephiumConnectProvider. \n\nFinally, the exported hooks include useAccount, useConnect, useTxStatus, and useBalance. These hooks can be used to access various information related to the user's account, connection status, transaction status, and balance. \n\nOverall, this module provides a convenient way for developers to integrate the AlephiumConnectProvider into their web3 applications and access various related information. Here is an example of how to use the AlephiumConnectProvider and AlephiumConnectButton components:\n\n```\nimport { AlephiumConnectProvider, AlephiumConnectButton } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <AlephiumConnectProvider>\n      <div>\n        <h1>Welcome to my Alephium app!</h1>\n        <AlephiumConnectButton />\n      </div>\n    </AlephiumConnectProvider>\n  )\n}\n```",
