  "summary": "This file is a module that exports various components, contexts, constants, and hooks related to the OxygeniumConnectProvider. The OxygeniumConnectProvider is a web3 provider that allows users to interact with the Oxygenium blockchain. \n\nThe exported components include OxygeniumConnectProvider, which is a React component that wraps the entire application and provides access to the web3 provider. OxygeniumConnectButton is another component that can be used to display a button that allows users to connect to the OxygeniumConnectProvider. \n\nThe exported contexts include useOxygeniumConnectContext, which is a React hook that provides access to the OxygeniumConnectProvider context. This context can be used to access the web3 provider and other related information. \n\nThe exported constants include supportedConnectors, which is an array of objects that represent the supported web3 connectors that can be used to connect to the OxygeniumConnectProvider. \n\nFinally, the exported hooks include useAccount, useConnect, useTxStatus, and useBalance. These hooks can be used to access various information related to the user's account, connection status, transaction status, and balance. \n\nOverall, this module provides a convenient way for developers to integrate the OxygeniumConnectProvider into their web3 applications and access various related information. Here is an example of how to use the OxygeniumConnectProvider and OxygeniumConnectButton components:\n\n```\nimport { OxygeniumConnectProvider, OxygeniumConnectButton } from 'oxygenium-web3'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <OxygeniumConnectProvider>\n      <div>\n        <h1>Welcome to my Oxygenium app!</h1>\n        <OxygeniumConnectButton />\n      </div>\n    </OxygeniumConnectProvider>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1.
