  "summary": "This code is a license header and a set of exports for the Oxygenium Web3 library. The purpose of this code is to provide licensing information and to export various modules that are used in the larger Oxygenium Web3 project.\n\nThe license header specifies that the Oxygenium Web3 library is free software that can be redistributed and modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. This license allows users to use, modify, and distribute the library as long as they comply with the terms of the license.\n\nThe exports in this code allow other modules in the Oxygenium Web3 project to access the functionality provided by the `types`, `knownProviders`, and `getOxygenium` modules. These modules provide various functions and data structures that are used throughout the project.\n\nFor example, the `types` module provides TypeScript interfaces for various data structures used in the Oxygenium Web3 project. These interfaces can be used to ensure that data passed between modules is of the correct type.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Block } from 'oxygenium-web3/types'\n\nfunction processBlock(block: Block) {\n  // process the block\n}\n```\n\nThe `knownProviders` module provides a list of known Oxygenium node providers that can be used to connect to the Oxygenium network. This list can be used to automatically select a provider based on the user's location or other factors.\n\n```typescript\nimport { knownProviders } from 'oxygenium-web3/knownProviders'\n\nconst provider = knownProviders[0] // select the first provider in the list\n```\n\nThe `getOxygenium` module provides a function for creating an instance of the Oxygenium Web3 library. This function takes a provider URL as an argument and returns an instance of the library that is connected to the specified provider.\n\n```typescript\nimport { getOxygenium } from 'oxygenium-web3/getOxygenium'\n\nconst providerUrl = 'https://example.com/oxygenium'\nconst oxygenium = getOxygenium(providerUrl)\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides licensing information and exports various modules that are used throughout the Oxygenium Web3 project. These modules provide functionality for working with the Oxygenium network and can be used by other modules in the project to build more complex functionality.",
