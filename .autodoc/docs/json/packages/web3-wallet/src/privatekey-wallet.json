  "summary": "This file contains a TypeScript module that exports a class called `PrivateKeyWallet`. This class is a subclass of `SignerProviderSimple`, which is a class from the `@oxygenium/web3` package. The `PrivateKeyWallet` class is an in-memory HDWallet that can be used for simple use cases. \n\nThe `PrivateKeyWallet` class has several properties, including `keyType`, `privateKey`, `publicKey`, `address`, `group`, `nodeProvider`, and `explorerProvider`. The `keyType` property is a string that specifies the type of key used by the wallet. The `privateKey` property is a string that contains the private key of the wallet. The `publicKey` property is a string that contains the public key of the wallet. The `address` property is a string that contains the address of the wallet. The `group` property is a number that specifies the group of the wallet. The `nodeProvider` property is an instance of the `NodeProvider` class, which is also from the `@oxygenium/web3` package. The `explorerProvider` property is an instance of the `ExplorerProvider` class, which is also from the `@oxygenium/web3` package.\n\nThe `PrivateKeyWallet` class has several methods, including `unsafeGetSelectedAccount()`, `getPublicKey()`, `account()`, `constructor()`, `Random()`, `FromMnemonic()`, `FromMnemonicWithGroup()`, `signRaw()`, and `sign()`. The `unsafeGetSelectedAccount()` method returns a `Promise` that resolves to the `account` property of the wallet. The `getPublicKey()` method takes an `address` parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves to the public key of the wallet if the `address` parameter matches the `address` property of the wallet. The `account()` method returns an object that contains the `keyType`, `address`, `publicKey`, and `group` properties of the wallet. The `constructor()` method is the constructor of the `PrivateKeyWallet` class. It takes an object that contains the `privateKey`, `keyType`, `nodeProvider`, and `explorerProvider` properties of the wallet. The `Random()` method generates a random `PrivateKeyWallet` instance. The `FromMnemonic()` method generates a `PrivateKeyWallet` instance from a mnemonic phrase. The `FromMnemonicWithGroup()` method generates a `PrivateKeyWallet` instance from a mnemonic phrase and a target group. The `signRaw()` method takes a `signerAddress` parameter and a `hexString` parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a string that contains the signature of the `hexString` parameter using the private key of the wallet if the `signerAddress` parameter matches the `address` property of the wallet. The `sign()` method takes a `privateKey` parameter, a `hexString` parameter, and a `_keyType` parameter and returns a string that contains the signature of the `hexString` parameter using the `privateKey` parameter. \n\nOverall, this file provides a class that can be used to generate and manage private keys and sign transactions for the Oxygenium blockchain. It can be used in conjunction with other classes and modules from the `@oxygenium/web3` package to build decentralized applications on the Oxygenium blockchain.",
