      "summary": "This code is a JSON object that contains information about a contract called \"GreeterMain\". The contract is likely written in a language that compiles to bytecode, as evidenced by the \"bytecodeTemplate\" field. The \"fieldsSig\" field describes the contract's fields, which in this case is a single field called \"greeterContractId\" of type \"ByteVec\". The \"functions\" field describes the contract's functions, which in this case is a single function called \"main\". \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide metadata about the \"GreeterMain\" contract, which can be used by other parts of the project to interact with the contract. For example, the bytecode template can be used to deploy the contract to a blockchain network, and the function metadata can be used to call the \"main\" function with the correct parameters. \n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nconst contractMetadata = {\n  \"version\": \"v2.3.1\",\n  \"name\": \"GreeterMain\",\n  \"bytecodeTemplate\": \"01010300020014{0}17000c0d160001000d2f0c7b{0}17010c0d160101000d2f0c7b\",\n  \"fieldsSig\": {\n    \"names\": [\n      \"greeterContractId\"\n    ],\n    \"types\": [\n      \"ByteVec\"\n    ],\n    \"isMutable\": [\n      false\n    ]\n  },\n  \"functions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"main\",\n      \"usePreapprovedAssets\": true,\n      \"useAssetsInContract\": false,\n      \"isPublic\": true,\n      \"paramNames\": [],\n      \"paramTypes\": [],\n      \"paramIsMutable\": [],\n      \"returnTypes\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n// Deploy the contract to the blockchain\nconst bytecode = contractMetadata.bytecodeTemplate.replace('{0}', '0123456789abcdef')\nconst deployedContract = web3.eth.contract(contractMetadata.fieldsSig.types).new(\n  '0123456789abcdef',\n  {\n    data: bytecode,\n    from: web3.eth.accounts[0],\n    gas: 1000000\n  },\n  (err, contract) => {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error(err)\n      return\n    }\n    if (contract.address) {\n      console.log('Contract deployed at address:', contract.address)\n    }\n  }\n)\n\n// Call the \"main\" function on the contract\ndeployedContract.main((err, result) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err)\n    return\n  }\n  console.log('Main function result:', result)\n})\n```\n\nIn this example, the contract metadata is used to deploy the contract to the blockchain and call the \"main\" function. The \"bytecodeTemplate\" field is used to generate the bytecode for the contract, and the \"fieldsSig\" field is used to specify the types of the contract's fields. The \"functions\" field is used to specify the name and signature of the \"main\" function, which is then called on the deployed contract.",

What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code defines a contract called \"GreeterMain\" with a single function called \"main\" that takes no parameters and returns nothing. The bytecodeTemplate field contains the bytecode for the contract.\n2. What version of the software is this code for?\n   - This code is for version 2.3.1 of the software.\n3. What is the purpose of the \"fieldsSig\" object?\n   - The \"fieldsSig\" object defines the names, types, and mutability of the contract's fields. In this case, there is only one field called \"greeterContractId\" of type \"ByteVec\" that is not mutable."

          "summary": "This code represents a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used to create decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is called \"Add\" and its bytecode is provided in the code snippet. The contract has four functions: \"add\", \"addPrivate\", \"createSubContract\", and \"destroy\". \n\nThe \"add\" function is a public function that takes an array of two 256-bit unsigned integers and returns an array of two 256-bit unsigned integers. The function adds the two integers in the input array and returns the result. \n\nThe \"addPrivate\" function is a private function that takes an array of two 256-bit unsigned integers and returns an array of two 256-bit unsigned integers. The function adds the two integers in the input array and returns the result. However, this function is not accessible to the public and can only be called by other functions within the contract. \n\nThe \"createSubContract\" function is a public function that creates a new sub-contract. It takes four parameters: a 256-bit unsigned integer, a byte vector, a byte vector, and an address. The function creates a new sub-contract with the given parameters and returns nothing. \n\nThe \"destroy\" function is a public function that destroys the contract. It takes one parameter, an address, and returns nothing. The function can only be called by the address provided as the parameter. \n\nThe contract also includes an events signature, which defines two events: \"Add\" and \"Add1\". Both events have two fields, \"x\" and \"y\", which are 256-bit unsigned integers. \n\nOverall, this contract provides basic functionality for adding two 256-bit unsigned integers and creating and destroying sub-contracts. It can be used as a building block for more complex smart contracts that require these functionalities. Below is an example of how the \"add\" function can be called in Solidity:\n\n```\ncontract MyContract {\n  function addNumbers(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256[2] memory) {\n    uint256[2] memory input = [a, b];\n    return Add.add(input);\n  }\n}\n```",

Both fields are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once the contract is deployed. \n\nThe contract also includes a single function called \"main\". This function is marked as public, meaning it can be called by anyone on the network. It takes no parameters and returns nothing. The purpose of this function is to add the specified asset to a blacklist, effectively destroying it. \n\nThe contract includes two options for handling assets: \"usePreapprovedAssets\" and \"useAssetsInContract\".

It can be used as a template for creating similar contracts with different asset types or destruction criteria. \n\nExample usage:\n\nAssuming the contract has been deployed on the network, a user can call the \"main\" function to destroy a specified asset.

The `add` subfolder contains JSON files for contracts that perform addition operations and manage assets, while the `greeter` subfolder contains a simple \"Greeter\" contract that returns a greeting message. The `sub` subfolder contains a \"Sub\" contract that performs subtraction operations.\n\nThese contracts can be used as building blocks for more complex decentralized applications on the Oxygenium blockchain network. For example, a developer could use the \"Add\" contract from the `add` subfolder to create a new contract that performs arithmetic operations on user-provided input:\n\n```solidity\ncontract MyContract {\n  function addNumbers(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256[2] memory) {\n    uint256[2] memory input = [a, b];\n    return Add.add(input);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/artifacts` folder provides metadata about various smart contracts in the `oxygenium-web3` project, which can be used by developers to interact with the contracts and build applications on top of them. The JSON files include information about the contract's bytecode, fields, functions, and events, allowing developers to deploy the contracts, call their functions, and emit events as needed.",
